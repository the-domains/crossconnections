draw water from the wells of salvation. ~Isaiah 12:3</b></p><p>What exactly is joy,
anyway? The Bible talks a lot about joy, but it's not a word we use much
outside of "church" circles, so we're often fuzzy on what the word
means.</p><p>So before we see what connection
joy has with the cross, it might be a good idea to first do a little Bible
survey to see what God says about joy itself. We don't want to be content with
vague, fuzzy ideas; vague ideas lead to vague lives. Remember: the Holy Spirit
uses his inspired words in Scripture to transform us, so we want to know what
he says specifically and precisely. So, what is joy?</p><p>JOY VS. HAPPINESS</p><p>One thing that I've heard
frequently is that there is a big difference between joy and happiness.</p><p>I've heard whole sermons based on this
premise.</p><p>Usually it goes something lie this:
"Happiness is an emotion based on temporary, changing circumstances or
possessions; joy is a state of heart based on a relationship with God."</p><p>Okay, I understand that.
That's probably an accurate description of the distinction we draw between joy
and happiness in our everyday conversations. And certainly, there is a great
difference between basing your emotional wellbeing on stuff you own or on
changing circumstances, versus standing secure on the unchanging rock of Christ
Jesus.</p><p>The problem is, that
distinction between joy and happiness is not found anywhere in the Bible.</p><p>In fact, the Bible uses the words
"happiness" and "joy" completely interchangeably, with
apparently no distinction. They're synonyms in the Bible. I'll bet you've never
realized this, probably because you've never seen the word "happiness"
in the Bible. The reason for that is that our modern Bible translations almost
always translate the biblical word "happy" (the Greek word is
makarios) as "blessed."</p><p>But
that's exactly what that Greek word makarios means; it means "happiness or
wellbeing."</p><p>Why translators choose
to take an easy-to-understand word like "happiness" and render it as
a thoroughly religious and opaque word like "blessed" is a mystery to
me.</p><p>So when you read the
Beatitudes in Matthew 5, for example, this is what Jesus is saying:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Happy are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Happy are those who mourn </i></p><p>(there's a conundrum if ever there was one!)</p><p><i>, for they shall be comforted.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Happy are the meek, for they shall inherit the
earth.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Happy are those who hunger and thirst for
righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Happy are the merciful, for they shall receive
mercy.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Happy are the pure in heart, for they shall see
God.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Happy are the peacemakers, for they shall be called
sons of God.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Happy are those who are persecuted for
righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i></p><p>In the Beatitudes, Jesus
is saying, "You want to be happy, don't you? You've been going about it
all wrong.</p><p>The pathway to real happiness
is the exact opposite of what you thought it was."</p><p>Actually, it's in the
Beatitudes that we are shown how "happiness" and "joy" are
synonymous.</p><p>Jesus continues, and in
verse 11-12 blows our artificial categories out of the water:</p><p><b><i></i></b></p><p><b><i>Happy</i></b></p><p> are you
when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against
you falsely on my account. </p><p><i><b>Rejoice</b></i></p><p>
and </p><p><i><b>be glad</b></i></p><p>, for your reward is
great in heaven.</p><p>Do you see how he uses
"happiness" and "joy" and "gladness"
interchangeably?</p><p>He says, "If
people persecute you, be happy, rejoice, be glad."</p><p>Those aren't three different things; those
are three ways of saying the same thing. It's a classic example of Hebrew
parallelism where the same idea is repeated in a slightly different form.</p><p>So right at the outset of
this study on joy, we need to get the idea out of our heads, that joy and
happiness are somehow different.</p><p>Again,
I do understand how we tend to use those words differently in our everyday
conversations.</p><p>But I want my thinking
and speaking to be shaped by the way the Bible thinks and speaks, not the other
way around.</p><p>And the Bible uses the words
"joy," "happiness," and "gladness"
interchangeably.</p><p>"Delight" and
"exult" are two other very closely related words.</p><p>"Delight" means to find your
joy/happiness in a specific thing (as in, "Delight yourself in the
Lord"), and "exult" means "to rejoice triumphantly" (I
love that word; ponder what it means to not just have joy, but triumphant joy).</p><p>Therefore, when the Bible
talks about the joy that Christians should have, don't draw a distinction from happiness
that the Bible doesn't intend.</p><p>Rather,
what Scripture is getting at is where our happiness is supposed to be found--
not in material things or changing circumstances, but in the unchanging God of
grace and His blood-bought promises.</p><p>THE COMMAND TO BE HAPPY</p><p>All of this leads us to a
conclusion that may be startling to you: joy is an emotion, just like happiness
is an emotion. We can sometimes skirt around that truth by trying to draw false
distinctions between the two, but the Bible won't let us.</p><p>Joy is an emotion.</p><p>The reason that this is
somewhat startling is because God commands us to have joy.</p><p>"Rejoice in the Lord always; again I
will say, rejoice" (Philippians 4:4).</p><p>That's not a command to have your soul confident in God or some other
vague, spiritual-sounding notion like that; that's a command to be happy, and
to find your happiness in the Lord.</p><p>Or
consider the psalms: "Let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them
ever sing for joy."</p><p>Again, that's a
command.</p><p>To take refuge in God in a glum
or downcast or uptight or pessimistic manner is a contradiction.</p><p>In fact, it turns out that
God is deadly serious about our joy.</p><p>In
Deuteronomy 28, the experience of Israel gives us a sober warning:
"Because you did not serve the LORD your God with joyfulness and gladness
of heart, because of the abundance of all things, therefore you shall serve
your enemies."</p><p>Serving God without
"joyfulness and gladness of heart" makes a mockery of our service and
communicates that God is boring and that serving God is drudgery.</p><p>Therefore, God takes our joy seriously.
Because he is the most valuable, beautiful, glorious, desirable Reality in the
universe, he intends to be seen as valuable, beautiful, glorious, and desirable
in our emotional response to him. As Jeremy Taylor said, "God threatens
terrible things if we will not be happy."</p><p>One clarification is in
order, lest we misunderstand what the Bible is saying.</p><p>The fact that God commands us to be
happy/joyful in him does not mean that we are supposed to be some sort of
chipper, smiling, upbeat, obnoxious optimists who aren't allowed to be sad
about anything.</p><p>There is a place for
weeping in the Christian life; there is a place for grief.</p><p>The difference is that Christian weeping and
grief is always laced with hopeful joy and intent on loving others through the
pain.</p><p>"Rejoice with those who
rejoice; weep with those who weep," we are told in Romans 12.</p><p>That means God commands that our emotions
serve others in love.</p><p>"Weep with
those who weep" doesn't mean "Despair and be depressed with those who
are in despair and depression."</p><p>It
means, come alongside those who struggle; empathize with them; be willing to
feel their pain and enter into their situation and see things through their
eyes; so identify with their pain that it becomes your pain, and you weep along
with them.</p><p>That's a hard command-- and
the only possible way to sustain that kind of love is if you have deeply rooted
joy and gladness in God that says, "Though the fig tree should not blossom,
nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield
no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls,
yet I will rejoice in the LORD; I will take joy in the God of my
salvation" (Habakkuk 3:17-18).</p><p>In this
fallen, broken world, our joy will not be a naive, chipper grin that is
oblivious to the pain around us.</p><p>Rather,
we will be "sorrowful, yet always rejoicing" (2 Corinthians 6:10).</p><p>Our joy should always be laced with an
empathetic, loving, longing-for-heaven sorrow, and our sorrow should always be
laced with a yet-I-will-rejoice, God-is-my-salvation joy.</p><p>Does it bother you that
God commands your emotions? You might think, "I don't have control over my
emotions; how can God command me to feel a certain way?" But God doesn't
just command us to do certain things, and believe certain things, and think
certain thing; he also commands us to feel certain things. God's commands
aren't limited to what we, in our fallen condition, think we're capable of;
God's commands reflect his holy character and perfect requirements for us.</p><p>If you think you're not capable of
controlling your emotions, you're right. The Christian life is not something
you can do on your own resources; it is supernatural. It takes daily miracles
of grace for us to feel what we are supposed to feel. Seeing a command in the
Bible like, "Serve the LORD with gladness" should make us desperate
supernatural aid, for the Holy Spirit's help to change our hearts and empower a
radical obedience that penetrates all the way down to the very center of who we
are-- our emotions.</p><p>WHERE DOES YOUR JOY COME FROM?</p><p>So then, the question
pressed in on us by God's word is not whether or not God commands our
emotions.</p><p>He does, and he commands us to
be joyful.</p><p>The question is where we will
find that joy-- what will be the basis of our happiness?</p><p>The world certainly has an
answer to that question.</p><p>We tend to find
our joy in two places: in the present-- our current possessions, circumstances,
and relationships; and in the future-- our anticipations, hopes, and
dreams.</p><p>We find happiness in owning that
new car or new computer; there is something about buying new things that
touches a longing deep inside of us.</p><p>We
find happiness in our present circumstances; having an early morning cup of
coffee overlooking a misty woodland scene as the sun rises over a mountain
lake-- those kind of peaceful, quiet moments touch that same longing.</p><p>We find happiness in our present relationships;
celebrating with our friends, an earnest late night conversation with someone
close to you, holding your newborn son in your arms for the first time.</p><p>We also find joy in
contemplating the future (well, sometimes, at least; the uncontrollable future
also has a way of provoking anxiety). </p><p>When you were younger, waking up on the first
day of summer vacation, with its seemingly endless golden days stretching ahead
of you with all their promise of fun, prompted deep emotions of happiness.
Looking forward to your upcoming vacation is almost better than the vacation
itself. The reason Christmas is such an enjoyable season (apart from all its
accompanying frenetic busyness) is in the anticipation; we are looking forward
to Christmas morning.</p><p>The day itself
always arrives with a certain sort of letdown; we have been anticipating it for
so long that once it's finally here, it can't quite deliver on its promise of
happiness.</p><p>That problem right there
starts getting to the heart of the world's offer of happiness. All those things
I just described are good things.</p><p>They
should bring us a measure of joy. In fact, God created them to bring us a
measure of joy-- we'll unpack that more a little later.</p><p>But the problem with all
these things is that they are too fleeting to really provide lasting joy, and
too small to satisfy those deep longings in every person's heart.</p><p>Those things were made for us, to bring us
joy; but we were not made for them-- we were made for more.</p><p>When we look to them to really fulfill our
longings, they can never deliver.</p><p>We
eagerly anticipate Christmas morning, only to find that the experience itself
is a letdown; it can't deliver on its promise of real and lasting joy.</p><p>Those new cars and new computers that brought
us so much delight are quickly break down, or get lost, and soon our attention
is focused on that next new thing that will finally make us happy.</p><p>This is the reason Jesus told us to store up
our treasure somewhere else ("storing up our treasure" is just
another way of saying, "find your joy"); even the best things you love
are "treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves
break in and steal" (Matthew 6:19).</p><p>We were made for deeper, more lasting pleasures than what this world can
offer.</p><p>In Job 20:5, we're told that
"the joy of the godless is but for a moment."</p><p>There is joy to be found in this world apart
from God; but it's only a fleeting happiness that will betray you the moment
you try to make it your real satisfaction.</p><p>And so, in their quest for
joy, most people end up making idols out of the things that God has made, and
making those things the center of their lives. Not only does this lead to
futility, but also, when those things command our devotion, we quickly end up
using them in ways God has told us not to. Everything God created is good, but
God has placed loving restrictions on many of those things.</p><p>Sexual pleasure, for example, is good and
created by God, but is designed to only operate fully and effectively in the
God-appointed bounds of marriage. But when God is not the center of our joy, we
quickly start pursuing pleasure outside of his appointed bounds, and disaster
follows. No happiness pursued outside of God's will can last or truly satisfy.</p><p>I love this line from one
of John Newton's hymns, which lays out the problem and points us to the
solution:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Fading is the worldling's pleasure,</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>All his boasted pomp and show;</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Solid joys and lasting treasure</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>None but Zion's children know</i></p><p>In our quest for
happiness, we've too quickly settled for the fading pleasure that this world
runs after. Better by far to press on to what God's children have tasted and
seen: solid joys and lasting treasure.</p><p>SOLID JOYS</p><p>So where do we find these
"solid joys" that we were made for?</p><p>It turns out that our pursuit of worldly happiness wasn't too far off the
mark.</p><p>Like we've seen, we tend to look
for happiness in the present and the future-- our present possessions,
circumstances, and relationships; and in the anticipation, hopes, and dreams of
those things in the future.</p><p>One reason
that approach is so close, and yet so far, is that those things do give a
measure of joy; but they were made to serve in bringing us to the greatest end
for which we were made-- joy in God-- not to be ends in and of themselves. And
secondly, looking for joy in the present and future is how we have been wired;
we've just been looking to the wrong things. We were made to find our joy in
the present experience of God and future promises of God, rooted in the past
grace of God.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>WIELDING WORLDLY PLEASURE IN THE FIGHT FOR JOY</b></p><p>So how should we use all
the things in this world that bring us happiness?</p><p>How can friends, and pizza, and cars, and
vacation, and Christmas help us to better obey the command, "Rejoice in
the Lord always?" The Apostle Paul touches a massively significant truth
when, almost in passing, he gives us a worldview lens through which to see
worldly pleasures:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>[these pleasures] God created to be
received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. For
everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is
received with thanksgiving, for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.
~1 Timothy 4:3-4</i></p><p>There are some
spectacularly massive realities that emerge in this simple passage.</p><p>First, notice what Paul says about these
pleasures and who they were created for-- "God created [them] to be
received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth." This
means that every good thing in the world-- in other words, everything God
made-- exists for the enjoyment of believers, and believers only.</p><p>God did not create material blessings so that
he could be robbed by unbelievers who exchange his glory in order to worship
and serve those created things. Only Christians have a right to enjoy what God
has made, within the bounds that he has set for them. The fact that everyone
still can have enjoyment and pleasure in what God has made-- even when abusing
those pleasures outside of God's appointed bounds-- is grace, not a human
right. Every good thing in the world that unbelievers enjoy is "kindness
meant to lead to repentance," not something anybody deserves.</p><p>Do you see how this
relates to the cross? If every food you've ever eaten, every peaceful moment
you've experienced, every happy emotion you've ever had, is only yours because
of grace and is the opposite of what you deserve, then every second of your
life has been lived on the mercy of God.</p><p>Remember the Jerry Bridges quote from the introduction? "The best
kept secret among Christians is this: Jesus paid it all. I mean all. He not only
purchased your forgiveness of sins and your ticket to Heaven, He purchased
every blessing and every answer to prayer you will ever receive. Every one of
them- no exceptions."</p><p>Every one of
those undeserved blessings-- every feeling of happiness, every moment of joy--
was purchased for you by Jesus' blood on the cross.</p><p>The second thing we can
learn from 1 Timothy 4 about wielding worldly pleasure in the fight for joy is
that God intends for all our worldly blessings to be received with
thanksgiving.</p><p>That sounds obvious,
right? Your mom taught you to thank God for the food every meal before you
started eating. </p><p>What does that have to
do with joy?</p><p>It has everything to do
with joy, if we will have eyes to see. Thanksgiving is the key to joy.</p><p>Without gratitude, every pleasure we
experience will be like a drug, giving a fleeting glimpse of what we desire,
but eventually turning inward and ingrown and consuming us alive with
ever-increasing costs and ever-diminishing rewards. This is, ultimately, the
tragedy of a life lived without God; that's why Job 20:5 tells us that
"the joy of the godless lasts but a moment." Without thankfulness
there can be no true and lasting happiness.</p><p>But combined with
gratitude, every pleasure on this planet can be transformed into worship.</p><p>C.S. Lewis recounted a story that illustrates
this principle.</p><p>He told the story of
how, one day, he walked into his toolshed and closed the door. Through a crack
in the wooden walls shone a thin beam of sunlight, illuminating specks of dust
floating inside the shed.</p><p>Standing with
the closed door behind his back, all that Lewis could see in that darkened
toolshed were those suspended motes of dust, and everything else was pitch
black.</p><p>But then he moved to where the
beam was, and instead of looking at the beam and its floating dust specks, he
bent down until the beam of light fell on his eye.</p><p>Suddenly, he was looking through the crack in
the wall, out into the brilliant light of day, straight into the sun.</p><p>All of the pleasures and
joys in this world are like those suspended motes of dust illuminated by a ray
of light. In a darkened room, that ray of light is beautiful. But the tragedy
is that so many people in this darkened world, in looking for light and joy and
beauty and meaning, see those pleasures and fixate on them, instead of letting
their eye run up the beam of light to the sun.</p><p>"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down
from the Father of lights" (James 1:17), and all those gifts are given,
not so that we would fall in love with the gift, but so so that the eyes of our
heart would run up the beam to the Giver, and love him more.</p><p>Jeremiah Burroughs, a 17</p><p><i></i><sup>th</sup></p><p>-century
Puritan, learned to wield worldly pleasures in the fight for joy, and to see
the gospel in all of them: </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"I have what I have from the
love of God,</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>and I have it sanctified to me by
God,</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>and I have it free of cost from God</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>by the purchase of the blood of
Christ,</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>and I have it as a forerunner of
those eternal mercies that are reserved for me."</i></p><p>Here's how God intends
worldly pleasures to work: you take a bite of food and the flavor explodes in
your mouth.</p><p>Yummy, delicious happiness
results. In that moment, don't focus in on the food and how good it is; let
your eye run up the beam of the gift to the Giver; say in your heart,
"Father, thank you for such a gift! Thank you for mercy that gives this to
me and makes me able to enjoy it.</p><p>And if
this is so good, how much better must you be! Help me to love you more than I
love this food." When pleasure is combined with heartfelt prayer like
that, joy will always be the result. It's what we were created to do.</p><p>Equipped with this
worldview, every blessing is an arrow pointing to the Father of lights from
whom it came.</p><p>Every pleasure is a
springboard into greater heights of gratitude and worship.</p><p>Every happiness this world can offer becomes
a sword to wield in the fight for joy, because they all point to the ultimate
well of joy: God himself.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE WELL OF JOY</b></p><p>Every other pleasure and
happiness in the world exists to point us to God as the supreme Joy, the One
for whom we were made. Only in him is true, deep, lasting joy found.</p><p>We were created to know him and be known by
him, to enjoy his glory, be enthralled by his beauty, and satisfied by his
goodness forever. "In your presence there is fullness of joy; at your
right hand are pleasures forevermore" (Psalm 16:11). He is the well of joy
that our restless, thirsty souls crave. </p><p>The problem is, in seeking
our joy elsewhere, we have abandoned the well of joy.</p><p>We have exchanged the unending fountain for
the dust and ashes of this world that, while they might bring momentary relief,
can never satisfy.</p><p>Jeremiah 2 lays out
this indictment in graphic terms:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Be appalled, O heavens, at this; be
shocked, be utterly desolate, declares the LORD, for my people have committed
two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out
cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that can hold no water. ~Jeremiah
2:12-13</i></p><p>You might think that your
tendency to love and desire pizza, or shopping, or your spouse, more than you
love and desire God, is no big deal. After all, you're only hurting yourself,
right? But the prophet Jeremiah, speaking for God, calls this behavior
"evil." It is evil to prefer a created thing over the Creator. It is
evil to seek your ultimate joy in that which was only designed to be an arrow
pointing to the Source of all joy. It is evil to forsake the Fountain of living
waters, which is always full and always flowing, always satisfying those who
come to him for life and joy, and turn to those things which are, in
comparison, dry and broken cisterns in the desert, which can never satisfy.</p><p>That's why Jeremiah calls
all of heaven to witness this atrocity: human beings, made in the image of God
to treasure his glory and reflect it to the world, in love with themselves and
with his creation.</p><p>"Be shocked, be
appalled," Jeremiah says.</p><p>Are you?
Or is the casual way that we pawn off God's invaluable glory for the world's
trinkets so ordinary to you that it doesn't shock you? Have you considered that
it is this very exchange, which you make on a daily basis, that made it
necessary for the Son of God to die for you? High payment must be paid to
recompense this treason, and Jesus Christ paid it in full-- so that you could
gain access again to the well of joy for which you were made. You may have
abandoned the Fountain, but the Fountain has not abandoned you.</p><p>The death and resurrection
of Jesus opens the door for us to know and enjoy the God we were made for.
"Christ suffered for sins, once for all, the righteous for the
unrighteous, that he might bring us to God" (1 Peter 3:18)-- that he might
bring us back to the Fountain, back to the well of joy, to enjoy and be
satisfied forever.</p><p>The highest blessings
of salvation-- peace with God, fellowship with him, access to his throne of
grace, assurance of his presence-- are exactly what will bring us the highest,
deepest, most lasting joy, because these blessings are what we were made for.</p><p>That's what our Cross Connection
verse, Isaiah 12, is getting at. "With joy you will draw water from the
wells of salvation." Here's what that picture means: the water from the
wells of salvation are all those blessings of fellowship and intimacy with God
that Jesus purchased for you on the cross. The gospel is an inexhaustible well
of blessings. That's the water our souls were designed to drink. The key to joy
is to come to the well of salvation daily-- hourly, even-- and continually draw
up gospel resources to drink and enjoy. No matter the changing circumstances
around you, the well of salvation is always full and always flowing, and God
extends his offer of fellowship to you all day, every day. </p><p>Practically speaking, this
is what that means: when you open your Bible to read it, don't just read
aimlessly; read with a specific purpose: that you would see gospel promises.
Look for gospel glory like Isaiah 12:1- "I will give thanks to you, O
LORD, for though you were angry with me, your anger turned away, that you might
comfort me." That verse is water from the well of salvation.</p><p>Reading promises like that, drawing them up
into your heart, meditating on them, praying them, believing them, and then
carrying them with you through the day-- this is the key to joy.</p><p>I don't want to stop
there, though; I think it would be helpful to get even more specific. Remember,
earlier I said that we tend to find our joy in present circumstances,
possessions, and relationships, and in the anticipation of the future? That
really is the way we're wired; and the problem is not finding our joy in the
present and future; the problem is what we're looking to in the present and
future to satisfy us. God intends for his present and future promises of peace
and intimacy with himself to be the water that we daily draw from the well of
salvation.</p><p>So what kind of promises
should we be drawing from the well of salvation to fuel our joy? Assurances
that connect the gospel of redemption and salvation to your present
circumstances: "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by
name, you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and
through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you
shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you. For I am the Lord
your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior" (Isaiah 43:1-3). Promises
and descriptions of your present relationship with God: "Since we have
been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ" (Romans 5:1). Breathtaking statements that, in Christ, God himself
is our everlasting possession: "Whom have I in heaven but you? And there
is nothing on earth that I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart may fail,
but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever" (Psalm
73:25-26). And we also look to the future, to the blood-bought promises of
future joy that will make every happiness and heartache here as nothing by
comparison, and the joy we have chased our entire lives will finally and fully
be ours: "The ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with
sining; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; they shall obtain gladness
and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away" (Isaiah 35:10). These are
the kinds of present and future realities that our souls were made to feed on
and delight in.</p><p>Making salvation the well
from which you draw your joy will help to steady your heart in changing
circumstances, through pain and trials, good times and bad times. With the
grace of the gospel feeding your joy, then all the other trinkets and pleasures
of the world will no longer have to be idols competing for your heart's
allegiance. The all-satisfying gospel gives freedom to finally enjoy all those
other things the way they were made-- as reminders of the thing that has fully
satisfied you: grace.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Father, I confess that I have so often forsaken
you, the Fountain of living waters, and hewed out for myself broken cisterns of
worldly pleasure that ultimately can hold no satisfying water. Only you can
fully satisfy my heart. Help me to believe that, to take hold of the
everlasting life of knowing you that you have given me in the gospel, and to
press on to know and obey and enjoy you more, so that your joy may be in me and
that my joy may be full.</i></p><p>Jesus, Thou joy of loving hearts,</p><p>Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men,</p><p>From the best bliss that earth imparts,</p><p>We turn unfilled to Thee again.</p><p>Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood:</p><p>Thou savest those that on Thee call.</p><p>To them that seek Thee Thou art good,</p><p>To them that find Thee all in all.</p><p>Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,</p><p>Wherever our changeful lot is cast;</p><p>Glad when Thy gracious smile we see,</p><p>Blessed when our faith can hold Thee fast.</p><p>We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,</p><p>And long to feast upon Thee still;</p><p>We drink of Thee, the Fountainhead,</p><p>And thirst our souls from Thee to fill.</p><p>~Bernard of Clairvaux, 12th century~</p><picture>
