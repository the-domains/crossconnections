Psalm 10:4 exposes pride for what it truly is: \"In\nthe pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are,\n'There is no God.'\" Pride is ultimately a refusal to acknowledge God as\nGod, seeking rather to substitute myself. That's why the psalmist says that all\nthe thoughts of the proud heart are, \"There is no God.\" That doesn't\nmean that only atheists are arrogant. It's actually the reverse; every arrogant\nthought and act is, at its core, an act of atheism in its rejection of God.\nThat is a terrible and sober truth, considering how the tentacles of pride so\nfrequently wrap themselves around so many of our thoughts, motives, and\nactions. How many of your thoughts, motives, and actions are actually\ndeclarations of atheism?</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"ef655c51-da0c-495d-abaf-d983a4f903a1","item":"a4a5bcd7-242a-4934-8105-930119a68a13","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"If you're anything like\nme, those were some convicting paragraphs.
