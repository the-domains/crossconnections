all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to
live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age. ~Titus
2:11-12</i></b></p><p>Self-control is a funny
thing; we all want the rewards of self-control, but nobody wants the hard work
that it actually requires. You would love to lose five pounds, but in the
actual moment of decision, the chocolate cake looks better than the prize of a
lower number on the scale. You'd like to get back into shape after the long
winter, but that would require actually getting outside and exercising. You try
to hold your tongue and be the bigger person when an irritating co-worker is
mouthing off again, but you "just can't help yourself," and blow up
again. You want to be more diligent and faithful in reading your Bible, but
when the alarm clock goes off in the morning, the snooze button seems to be
offering superior rest and pleasure.</p><p>This, in a nutshell, is
the problem of self-control. We know the rewards of patience and hard work and
perseverance, but the instant gratification-- whether it be chocolate or sleep
or anger-- simply seems better. A guaranteed yet smaller payoff now looks more
attractive than a hypothetical larger payoff later. And so time and time again,
we make irrational choices, choosing what's immediate over what's better.</p><p>But the problem of
self-control points us to the solution. If the problem is that immediate
gratification seems better than perseverance and patience, the solution is to
see and feel and believe that the reward waiting at the end of perseverance is
worth the wait. If I believe that the reward really is worth the wait,
self-control will feel like the obvious choice and will come much more easily.
Now, that sounds simple, but actually getting there, believing that, and living
that way is a different story.</p><p>That's why self-control is
more than just a self-help technique. These principles are certainly used to
great effect by psychiatrists, life coaches, and physical trainers, because
they're based on truth. But real self-control, of a more substantial and
significant quality than simply passing on a second helping of brownies, is a
supernatural fruit of the Holy Spirit alongside love, patience, goodness, and
the rest. Self-control is the result of the Holy Spirit's work in the
believer's heart to see the promises of God as so sure and so valuable as to
surpass the fleeting pleasures that worldliness offers. Self-control waits for
its reward, believing the reward is worth it. </p><p>MUNDANE AND MIRACULOUS</p><p>Titus 2 lays out the key
to self-control, connecting it clearly and profoundly to the cross in a way
that, if we can start to live in that connection, will most assuredly transform
our lives.</p><p>In Titus 2, Paul gives
general instructions for believers, and self-control and its fruits are very
close to the heart of his commands. "Older men are to be sober minded,
dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in
steadfastness," he says in verse 2. Older women are to keep watch over
their desires and by their words and examples to train the younger women
"to be self-controlled and pure" (2:5) among other things. Younger
men are urged "to be self-controlled [and] to show yourself in all
respects to be a model of good works" (2:6-7). Even those who find
themselves as slaves are instructed to rein in their tempers and worldly
desires and showcase the gospel in how they respond to those in authority over
them (2:9-10). This fruit of self-control is meant to permeate and define the
lives of believers, no matter the season or circumstance in which they find
themselves.</p><p>Finally, after giving
these commands in the first ten verses, Paul connects these instructions to the
cross in a breathtaking and glorious way in verses 11-14. This Cross Connection
reaches back into the eternal purposes of God and forward into the eternal
plans of God, and brings them to bear on the mundane and miraculous fruit of
self-control.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>For the grace of God has appeared,
bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly
passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present
age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God
and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all
lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are
zealous for good works.</i></p><p>In these four verses, Paul
shows us how self-control waits, with its faith founded in God's past grace and
looking forward to God's future grace.</p><p>THE FOUNDATION OF FAITH: PAST GRACE</p><p>Note the word
"for" at the beginning of verse 11. Once again, we're seeing how the
Bible's arguments and reasoning are central to how the Christian life is lived
out. After ten verses of commands and instructions, Paul is now giving the
reason for living this way: "For (because!) the grace of God has appeared,
bringing salvation for all people." The past appearance of God's grace, in
the person and work of Jesus Christ, is the foundation upon which the motivation
for self-control is built. </p><p>God's grace, of course,
appears everywhere every day, in sunshine and rain and blessings on the
righteous and the unrighteous (Matthew 5:45). Every moment of every day God
treats everyone better than they deserve. But the appearance of God's grace
that Paul has in mind here is the moment in history when the full display of
divine mercy shone the brightest: at the cross. The appearance of grace that
opened the floodgates of forgiveness and salvation to everyone who believes is
the moment when the Son of God hung as a sacrifice in the place of sinners,
absorbing in his broken body the punishment that our sin deserves. There is no
brighter display of the mercy, grace, and love of God than when Jesus
"gave himself to redeem us from all lawlessness."</p><p>Self-control, as we will
examine later, looks forward to its reward and to the second appearing of grace
for which it waits, "the appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus
Christ." But it's important to see, here at the beginning of our study,
that this anticipation of the future appearance of grace is firmly rooted in
the past appearance of grace. The forward-looking faith that sustains
self-control is not wishful thinking, optimism, or positive reinforcement. No,
self-control is fueled by the rock-solid assurance that every promise we
eagerly wait for was purchased, secured, and guaranteed for us by the blood of
Jesus.</p><p>We can see how the
foundation of past grace secures the anticipation of future grace in a precious
logical argument and promise in Romans 8:32:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>He who did not spare his own Son, but
gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all
things?</i></p><p>This is a logical argument
from the greater to the lesser. This type of argument says, in essence,
"If this comparatively harder thing has been done, then this comparatively
easier thing will surely be done as well." For example, if I'm willing to
stay up all night with my sick son (which is definitely a difficult thing to
do!), then of course I'll be willing to give him breakfast in the morning. The
fact that I did the more difficult thing proves that I'll do the easier thing
as well.</p><p>That's how the argument in
Romans 8:32 works (oh, for the Bible's logic to more fully shape how we
think!). The hardest, most astoundingly difficult thing that the Father could
possibly do would be to surrender that which is most precious to him, most
valuable-- namely, his own Son. And that's exactly what He has done for us. He
has not held back the treasure of his heart, but freely gave him to be our
sacrifice, to be our Savior. And if God has done this excruciatingly costly
thing, we can be sure that he will never hold back anything else good from us.
That's how this argument works: from the foundation of the infinite cost God
paid for our redemption, we know that the riches of his love will surely extend
to give us everything else we need. We never need to worry or fret about the
future, or selfishly stockpile resources for ourselves, because the cross
proves God's commitment to provide for us.</p><p>This is the first and most
important thing we need to see about how past grace functions in Titus 2:11-14.
The past grace of God that appeared when the Father gave us his Son is the
foundation and guarantee that as we wait for future grace, will will surely get
what we hope for. Faith looks back to past grace, and based on that certainty,
looks forward to the as-yet-unfulfilled promises of God. "Faith is the
assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen" (Hebrews
11:1).</p><p>THE EXERCISE OF FAITH: FUTURE GRACE</p><p>In order for our faith to
produce the fruit of self-control, the gaze of faith cannot remain simply
backwards-looking. We've seen the assurance and guarantee of grace in the
sacrifice of the Savior, but this particular fruit requires seeing how the
cross is connected to our future; namely, to all the promises of God that
haven't come true for us yet.</p><p>Verses 12-13 tells us that
after the grace of God has brought salvation to us, it starts training us in
godliness by teaching us to wait for what God has in store for us.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>For the grace of God has appeared,
bringing salvation for all people, </i></p><p><i><b>training
us</b></i></p><p> to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live
self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, </p><p><i><b>waiting</b></i></p><p>...</p><p>God's grace trains us to
let go of ungodliness and worldly passions in one hand while grasping
self-control, uprightness, and godliness in the other hand, and it does this in
a particular way: by teaching us to wait. The grammatical structure of the
sentence itself proves this; the participle "waiting" in verse 13
describes the way that we "renounce ungodliness and worldly passions"
and the way we "live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives." In
fact, "waiting" applies to and describes each one of those commands
individually. We renounce ungodliness, waiting. We renounce worldly passions,
waiting. We live self-controlled, waiting. We live uprightly, waiting. We live
godly lives, waiting. The act of waiting is the center of this passage.</p><p>So what is it about
waiting that is so vital to self-control in this passage? Remember what we said
about self-control earlier: self-control is the result of the Holy Spirit's
work in the believer's heart to see the promises of God as so sure and so
valuable as to surpass the fleeting pleasures that worldliness offers.
Self-control waits for its reward, believing the reward is worth it. As we keep
looking at Titus 2:11-14, that's exactly what we'll see next:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>For the grace of God has
appeared...training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to
live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for
our blessed hope, the appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ...</i></p><p>Standing on the foundation
of the past grace of the cross, Paul now seeks to motivate our self-control by
helping us to see two things: how fleeting and temporary the tempting pleasures
of worldliness are, and how joy-producing and unending the prize at the end of
the wait really is. Really seeing and believing these two things will change
the emotional calculus of how we weigh self-control and make decisions, and
will fuel our ability to say "no" to temporary pleasures in hopes of
a greater payoff later.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE PRESENT AGE</b></p><p>Notice the little word
"present" in verse 12, where we're told to live self-controlled,
upright, and godly lives in the "present age." Why do you think Paul
stuck in that little word? What does that add to his argument?</p><p>The point of that word is
this: this world and this age are temporary. Self-control is temporary. Even if
the wait feels interminable, even if saying "no" to temptation over
and over again feels like it lasts forever, we must have God's timeline
governing the way we think. And God's timeline says that this entire world is
temporary, fleeting, and quickly coming to a close. That's why Paul calls it
the "present age;" he's highlighting that this age is coming to an
end and will soon be eclipsed by an age that will not end, that cannot be
shaken, in which joy and life and glory will dawn and only get brighter and
brighter, forever.</p><p>This is the same hope that
Paul holds out in 2 Corinthians 4 to those who are suffering. "This light,
momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all
comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that
are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are
unseen are eternal" (2 Corinthians 4:17-18). Paul is certainly not being
glib or casual when he describes affliction as "light and momentary;"
he knows better than most what suffering feels like. Earlier in the same
letter, he tells the Corinthians, "We do not want you to be unaware,
brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly
burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself." Paul knew
that affliction doesn't usually feel light or momentary. But even when our
afflictions feel crushing and never-ending, the truth of Corinthians 4 holds
firm. In comparison to the eternal weight of glory for which those afflictions
are preparing us, the most horrific suffering in this present age is like a
pebble compared to a mountain, a drop compared to an ocean. Getting a true
perspective on eternity will put all of this life's difficulties and pains and
temptations into their proper place. </p><p>That's how the phrase
"present age" is supposed to motivate our self-control. Self-control
means saying "no" to a temptation or pleasure now, in order to hold
out for something better. One way to strengthen self-control's resolve is to
see that every temptation and pleasure, no matter how good it looks, no matter
how much it promises, belongs to this present age, and will quickly fade away
just like everything else in this world. How foolish we would be, then, to
trade that which is eternal for that which is momentary! Whatever momentary
rush of pleasure that sin is offering to you is not worth the cost; the
pleasure will be gone in a moment, replaced by guilt and regret, and it will
rob you of closer fellowship with the One who is your blessed hope.
Self-control sees this reality and says, "No, getting this pleasure now is
not worth it; I'm willing to wait for something better."</p><p>I'm eager now to launch
into practical applications and examples of this, but I'm intentionally holding
off until later in this chapter (hey, there's an example of self-control!),
because later we'll look at the characters in Hebrews 11 to see how they
exemplify this forward-looking faith and the fruit of self-control.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>OUR HAPPY HOPE</b></p><p>The fleeting transience of
worldly pleasures is now contrasted against the prize waiting at the end of
self-control: "our blessed hope, the appearing of our great God and Savior
Jesus Christ."</p><p>This is the reward
that makes all self-control on the road of godliness worth it, and takes every
act of faithful self-denial and transforms it into delayed self-gratification.
This is the happiness our hearts were designed to feel, the appearance that we
were made to long for, the Savior we were created to see and savor and
celebrate. And in stark contrast to the fleeting pleasures of sin in this
present age, the appearance of our great God and Savior will not be a
one-and-done event; rather, it will usher us into the everlasting joy of
Revelation 22:3-- "His servants will worship him. They will see his
face... and they will reign forever and ever." This is the joy of 1
Thessalonians 4:17-- "we will be forever with the Lord," and the
fulfillment of Psalm 16:11-- "in your presence there is fullness of joy;
at your right hand are pleasures forevermore." This is the hope and
motivation of Psalm 73:25-- "Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is
nothing on earth I desire besides you."</p><p>No joy, no temptation, no
pleasure in this present world, can compare with this happy hope (remember, the
word "blessed" means "happy"), because every joy and
pleasure in this world exists as an echo of this ultimate Joy and as an arrow
to point to this ultimate Hope. </p><p>Jonathan Edwards, the
Puritan pastor and theologian who was one of the primary lightning rods that
conducted God's power into the First Great Awakening in the mid 1700s, knew
this truth well. He knew that the joy of Christ's appearing would eclipse every
other joy that could possibly tempt us off the road of faith and self-control.
He wrote: </p><p>"To go to heaven,
fully to enjoy God, is infinitely better than the most pleasant accommodations
here. Fathers and mothers, husbands, wives, children, or the company of earthly
friends, are but shadows. But God is the substance. These are but scattered
beams, but God is the sun. These are but streams, but God is the fountain.
These are but drops, but God is the ocean... Why should we labor for, or set
our hearts on anything else, but that which is our proper end, and true
happiness?"</p><p>The way that self-control
functions in the Christian life is to set this hope-- God himself as the
substance, sun, fountain, and ocean of all true delight and endless satisfying
joy-- before the gaze of our hearts, and to continually say to our souls,
"Nothing but this! Let nothing distract you from this prize! Let nothing
detract from this joy!" Self-control looks at this future of
all-surpassing happiness long enough until that future happiness starts
spilling into the present, until the taste of joy in Jesus and the anticipation
of more fuels its obedience as it says "no" to temporary, lesser
pleasures.</p><p>THE EXAMPLE OF FAITH: HEBREWS 11</p><p>Hebrews 11, often called
"The Hall of Faith," is a case study in what forward-looking,
persevering faith looks like, and how it manifests itself in self-control and
self-denial as it forsakes temporary pleasure for everlasting gain. We'll look
at a couple of these characters to draw specific application to our lives.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>ENOCH</b></p><p>Enoch, one of the first
heroes of the faith in the Bible, was commended as having pleased God, and was
thereby one of only two people in history to never die (the other being
Elijah). When we meet him briefly in Genesis 5, we're not told how his faith
pleased God, but we are given a fuller explanation in Hebrews 11, an
explanation that provides a powerful foundation and motivation for the
forward-looking fruit of self-control.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>By faith Enoch was taken up so that
he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now
before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God. And without faith
it is impossible to please God, for </i></p><p><i></i><i><b>whoever
would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those
who seek him</b></i></p><p>. (11:5-6)</p><p>Enoch's faith is singled
out as what pleased God. That shouldn't be surprising, since we're told that
"without faith it is impossible to please God." What is more
surprising, however, is the content of that God-pleasing faith. Look again at
the last sentence more carefully. "Whoever would draw near to God must
believe" two things: one, that he exist (obviously), and two, that he
rewards those who seek him.</p><p>Saving faith, the kind of
faith that pleases God and enables sinners to draw near to him, believes two
central things about God: that he exists, and that he is a rewarder. Does that
second thing surprise you? Did you realize that the belief that God rewards
those who seek him isn't something extra or separate from faith, but is
literally the definition of what God-pleasing faith is? If you don't believe
that God rewards those who seek him, then your faith isn't pleasing to him and
doesn't give you access to him. In other words, if you don't believe that God
rewards those who seek him, you're not saved. Belief in a rewarding God is that
important, that central.</p><p>This probably strikes you
as odd, or even as wrong and dangerous, because most of us have been
conditioned to think that acting for the sake of reward is selfish or immoral.
We have to have a higher motive than gain, we think, otherwise we're acting
selfishly.</p><p>Simply put, this idea is
foreign to the Bible. Over and over again, Jesus offers reward to those who
follow him. Promise after promise in the Bible says, "Trusting me and
obeying me will be worth it in the end." The reward offered is not icing
on the cake of some nobler motivation; it is the motivation. Hebrews 11 goes
even further: if you're not motivated by the reward God holds out to you,
you're dishonoring him.</p><p>The reason God insists on
being the Rewarder in all our obedience and faith is that this preserves and
upholds his glory like no other motivation could. We aren't coming to him
offering our services to a needy god because of noble, selfless intentions in
our hearts. We come to him as beggars, needing what he gives and thankful when
he gives it. In all our service, in all our self-control, in all the fruits of
the Spirit, in every promise, God is the Giver-- and this means that we get the
grace, and he gets the glory.</p><p>C.S. Lewis wrote
extensively on this truth in his essay, "The Weight of Glory." Below
is an extended quote from him that's worth reading in its entirety, because it
gives us a powerful weapon in the fight of faith, and in particular, the fight
of self-control.</p><p>"The New Testament
has lots to say about self-denial, but not about self-denial as an end in
itself. We are told to deny ourselves and to take up our crosses in order that
we may follow Christ; and nearly every description of what we shall ultimately
find if we do so contains an appeal to desire. If there lurks in most modern
minds the notion that to desire our own good and earnestly to hope for the
enjoyment of it is a bad thing, I submit that this notion has crept in from
Kant and the Stoics and is no part of the Christian faith. </p><p><i></i><b>Indeed, if we consider the unblushing promises of reward and the
staggering nature of the rewards promised in the Gospels, it would seem that
our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak.</b></p><p> We are half-hearted
creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is
offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum
because he cannot imagine what is meant by an offer of a holiday at the sea. We
are far too easily pleased."</p><p>The secret that enabled
Enoch to please God, and the secret that will empower our own self-denial and
self-control, is this seeming contradiction: all the self-denial that God calls
us to is ultimately a form of delayed self-gratification. Jesus' command to
deny yourself, and Paul's command to train yourself in godliness and
self-control, is a command to stop "fooling about with drink and sex and
ambition when infinite joy is offered" to you. Self-control says "no"
to the temporary temptations and pleasures of this passing age, believing that
the reward of fuller fellowship with Jesus now, fuller enjoyment of his
appearing soon, and fuller capacities for joy now and forever, is a prize that
is worth any short-term sacrifice.</p><p>So here's the practical
question to consider: what acts of self-control is God calling you to? Is he
commanding you to restrain your pride and outbursts of anger in order to be a
more loving and faithful witness? If he calling you to make painfully
self-denying cuts to your budget in order to fund his work of missions to the
nations? Is he calling you to say "no" to the snooze button in order
to faithfully and diligently pursue him in your devotions each morning? What
are the promises he holds out to you in each of these areas, that he intends to
motivate your obedience? For example, if you're struggling with self-control in
regards to your anger, ponder his promise, "The meek shall inherit the
earth" (Matthew 5:5). He promises that those who, by grace, restrain their
tongue and put their strength under control, will rule with him in the new
heavens and the new earth... and those who don't, won't. Do you believe this
promise? Are you willing to bank on its truth and meditate on it until the
promise he holds out to you becomes more valuable than whatever gain you get by
lashing out in anger? God rewards those who seek him-- believing this is the
secret of self-control. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>ABRAHAM</b></p><p>Abraham is the second
character in the Hebrews 11 "Hall of Faith" from whom we can glean practical
instruction in how self-control waits for its reward and believes the reward is
worth it.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was
called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he
went out, not knowing where he was going. By faith he went to live in the land
of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs
with him of the same promise. </i></p><p><i><b>For he was
looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is
God</b></i></p><p>... People who speak thus desire a better country, that is, a heavenly
one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared
for them a city. (11:8-10,16)</p><p>God's call on Abraham was
a call to a lifetime of self-denial. God called him to leave his home and
family, the comforts, privileges, and protection of his comfort zone, and
follow God to the land of promise, which he would never actually receive in his
lifetime. Every day of Abraham's life, every day when he "had an
opportunity to return" (Hebrews 11:15), was an exercise of self-denial and
self-control.</p><p>It's crucially important
to see here that, just as we saw in Titus 2, and we saw in the life of Enoch,
and in the writings of C.S. Lewis, self-denial is not an end in itself, but a
means to delayed self-gratification. Hebrews 11 doesn't say that Abraham left
his homeland because he was looking forward to sacrifice and hardship (although
he certainly had to endure that). He began traveling the road of self-denial,
and endured on the road of self-denial, because "he was looking
forward" to a future city, a future home, and desiring "a better
country, that is, a heavenly one." For Abraham, leaving his family was a
journey to that better, heavenly country; the road of self-denial was the path
of pursuing the greatest possible future joy.</p><p>There is a wealth of
potential application here, but I will focus on one in particular: missions.
Our entire American culture, it seems, is designed to keep us on the
comfortable, easy road of indulgence and instant gratification that leads
toward wasted lives and, ultimately, destruction. Every step of the way, we are
told to pursue comfort, ease, success, popularity, position, possessions,
money. Indulge yourself and live your best life now! Buy the newest smartphone,
and you'll be happy! Get this job, and you'll have it all! Buy this house, and
you'll be comfortable and successful! Save for retirement, and you can play for
the last twenty years of your life!</p><p>While all these voices of
self-indulgence are calling out to us, however, there is another still, small
voice beckoning us to walk on a different road: the road of temporary
self-denial, sacrifice, and self-control. And like Abraham, I believe God is
calling many of us to uproot our lives, families, and futures, in order to be a
blessing to the nations. God has not blessed you with prosperity so that you
can be comfortable. He has blessed you so that, out of the overflow of your
abundance, missionaries can be funded, churches can be planted, wells be dug,
medicines be purchased, Scriptures be translated, and lost people from every
tribe and tongue brought into the everlasting joy of knowing the Savior.</p><p>To really believe this and
live this way means a lifestyle of self-denial, a wartime mentality that says,
"My resources are not mine, and I have been called to sacrifice and
self-control for the sake of the kingdom and the nations and the lost."
For more practical ideas and vision for this purpose, read the
"Generosity" and "Missions" chapters later in this book. A
commitment to this missions-driven self-control might mean that your life looks
like Abraham, as you leave your home and family to live in a foreign land. It
might look as simple (and yet profoundly difficult!) as saying "no"
to cable TV, so that your $80 a month can support evangelism among unreached
people groups. </p><p>Where does this kind of
self-denying, home-leaving, nations-blessing motivation come from? Hebrews 11
is clear: "looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose
designer and builder is God." Don't build your life on the shifting sand
of American priorities. America is a city without foundations, and a life built
on American priorities will crumble when the storm of eternity breaks upon it.
The unwasted life lays up its treasure in heaven by investing in the purposes
of that eternal city. This will take much self-control in how we spend our
money and time, but the promise makes it worth it: "Therefore, God is not
ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city."</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>MOSES</b></p><p>One more example of
forward-looking, promise-seeking self-control in Hebrews 11 is the story of
Moses.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>By faith Moses, when he was grown up,
refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to be
mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. </i></p><p><i></i><i><b>He considered the reproach of Christ
greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking forward to the
reward.</b></i></p><p> By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king,
for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. (11:24-26)</p><p>I love this passage. It's
practically a restatement of our original Cross Connection verse in Titus 2,
applied to the specific case of Moses. "Renounce ungodliness and worldly
passions, and live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present
age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of our great God and Savior
Jesus Christ." Moses considered, in one hand, a life of ease and
prosperity as a member of the royal family; and, in the other hand, a life of hardship
and reproach. But he saw the former for what it really was: the fleeting
pleasures of sin, a temporary buzz in the present age; and saw the latter for
what it really was: greater wealth than all of Egypt's treasures and the
all-surpassing reward of knowing and seeing the invisible God. In doing so,
Moses is a prime example of what self-control looks like for us: considering
hardship, sacrifice, and reproach as greater wealth than the treasures of
possessions, prosperity, and popularity, because we are looking forward to the
reward.</p><p>This is how self-control
works, both on a grand scale and in the day-to-day mundane decisions of life.
It means saying "no" to the snooze button because you believe that if
"one day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere" (Psalm
84:10), then twenty minutes in his presence is certainly better than twenty
extra minutes of sleep. It means the painful self-denial of standing unashamed
for Christ in your classroom or workplace, because you believe that "the
reproach of Christ is greater wealth" than any popularity, any grade, any
promotion. It means, perhaps, saying "no" to another slice of pizza
(shocking, I know!), not simply because healthy living is good, but because
self-denial in small things is good training for self-control in much more
important things. </p><p>I can't tell you all the
ways that God is calling you to exercise self-control and self-denial in your
life. But I'm pretty sure, based on the cushy standards of our American
lifestyle, that he's probably calling you and me to more self-control than
we're comfortable with. But I'm also confident, on the authority of God's
promises, that his command to self-control is absolutely worth it. As God's
grace trains you to look back to the cross and the price paid for you, and then
forward to all the promises that the cross secures for you, let one final
exhortation and example from Hebrews encourage you to fix your eyes on the One
who is not only our highest Treasure and greatest Reward, but also is himself
the perfect example of self-control.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Therefore, since we are surrounded by
so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin
which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set
before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, </i></p><p><i></i><i><b>who for the joy that was set before him
endured the cross</b></i></p><p>, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of
the throne of God. (12:1-2)</p><p>Jesus endured on the
ultimate road of self-denial the same way that we will: by looking to the joy
set before him. For Christ, the joy that motivated him was the anticipation of
purchasing the everlasting worship of a redeemed people. For us, the joy that
should motivate us is being part of that multitude, freed forever to enjoy his
beauty and make much of him. While we still live in this present age, let's
press on with endurance and self-control, waiting for our "happy
hope," the appearance of the One our souls long for, and let us continue
on the road of self-denial, casting aside anything that hinders us from seeing
and savoring and celebrating him, now and forever.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>High King of Heaven, help me to say with honesty
from the heart, "Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise; Thou my
inheritance now and always; Thou and thou only, first in my heart; High King of
heaven, my Treasure thou art." Be my highest Treasure, Lord Jesus, so that
all the temptations of this present world will loose their allurement and you,
you alone, will be first in my heart.</i></p><picture>
