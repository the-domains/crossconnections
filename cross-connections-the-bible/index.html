for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. ~2 Timothy 3:15</i></b></p><p>I'd like to give you a
window into my process of writing these Cross Connections. Over the course of
about four months, I spent many afternoons sitting in McDonald's with my
computer, an open Bible, and a fountain soda, working on this manuscript. Why
McDonald's, you ask? It's across the street from where I work, so it's a
convenient place to get stuff done. Also, french fries. </p><p>The result of these
several months of writing, besides gaining several pounds due to increased
french fry consumption, has been God turning my worldview upside down. Before I
began writing Cross Connections, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what I
would say and what it would look like. But as I have sat here day after day
looking at God's Word and tracing these connections for myself, I have been
completely blown away over and over again.</p><p>I thought I knew a lot
about the Bible; it has been humbling to see that I have only just begun to
scratch the surface. I thought I was already doing a fairly good job of living
out these Cross Connections; it has been humbling to see how little of my life
has really been transformed by the gospel, and just how big God's dreams for
his people are. No longer can I be content to live a "normal,"
"safe" little Christian life; the fullness and depth and riches of
glory that God has for those who will "go deep" and go radical and
risky with him are too much to ignore now that I've seen a little of them. I
want my life to count for eternal things, and for my moments and my days to be
used in his praise-- something I certainly wanted before, but which is now a
desire that has been lit on fire by his Word.</p><p>My experience writing this
has been some of the sweetest times alone with God that I've ever had (yes, you
can be "alone with God" at a table in McDonald's). As I have studied
his Word more diligently and closely than ever before, my eyes have been opened
to see things I never saw before, connections I had never made, depths of glory
and beauty I had never fathomed. I see the cross is everywhere, blazing off of
every page in Scripture, reflecting off of everything I see around me. And so
most of my times writing this book have simply been me sitting at McDonald's,
worshipping over my keyboard and open Bible as the Holy Spirit has opened my
eyes to see Jesus' beauty in new compelling ways.</p><p>Please don't hear this as
me boasting about how super-spiritual I am. ("Look at me, I love Jesus
more than you!") That's not my intention at all. Any good that has
happened in my own life through writing this, and any good that may come about
in your life, is the work of the Holy Spirit. Every growth in godliness, every
fresh sight of Jesus, every new insight into his word, is all his work, his
doing. I'm the beneficiary of amazing grace, nothing more. "Not to us, O
LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast
love and your faithfulness!" (Psalm 115:1)</p><p>BEHOLDING IS BECOMING</p><p>The reason I'm telling you
all this is to make a simple point: The way that God has turned my world upside
down, filled my heart with joy, and opened my eyes to a thousand news ways to
honor him... is through his Word. An open Bible has been the means of
transformation in my life. And I'm not a unique or special case; the way that
the Holy Spirit changes our lives and makes us more like Jesus is by opening
our eyes to see his glory in his Word. 2 Corinthians 3:18 gives us the recipe
for all true spiritual transformation:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory
of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory
to another. For this comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit. </i></p><p>It is the Holy Spirit who
lifts the "veil" of spiritual darkness from our eyes (2 Corinthians
3:14) and enables us to see "the glory of the Lord." And a true
spiritual sight of that glory, Paul says, results in "being transformed
into the same image." In other words, beholding is becoming. We will
become more like whatever captures the attention of our hearts. If you watch
television for four hours a day, you will become more like what you behold;
you'll find worldliness start to creep in and your patterns of thought shaped
by what you see on the screen. If you spend all your free time thinking about
your favorite sports team, your life will slowly start to be conformed to that
image; you'll wear the jerseys, schedule your time around games, and get more
involved with friends who share that passion. What you behold, you become.</p><p>But if, by God's grace,
the attention and devotion of "the eyes of your heart" are fixed on
the glory of the Lord, that's what you'll start to look like. His glory in the
gospel-- the glory of his love, his mercy, his meekness, his humility, his
power, his authority, his kindness-- will start to rub off on you and will
begin to influence the way you think about and respond to things in your life.
The way to become more like Jesus is to behold more of Jesus.</p><p>So here's the question:
how do you behold Jesus? He's no longer walking around with a group of
disciples to be observed. So how do we see Jesus? The answer is, the Holy
Spirit shows us Jesus in his Word. Listen to how Paul prays in Ephesians 1. He
prays:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>that the God of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of </i></p><p><i><b>revelation in the knowledge of him</b></i></p><p>,
having the eyes of your heart enlightened, </p><p><i><b>that
you may know</b></i></p><p> what is the hope to which he has called you...</p><p>Paul prays that the Holy
Spirit would open the eyes of our hearts, so that we would know things. And he
calls him "the Spirit of revelation in the knowledge of him." The
Spirit's job is to open our eyes in order to reveal knowledge about God. But
that doesn't happen in a vacuum; it doesn't come by meditating on a mountaintop
until the Holy Spirit gives you insight. No, the Holy Spirit does this through
his word. </p><p>Towards the end of
Colossians and Ephesians, Paul gives very similar practical instructions to
both groups of believers. In fact, the advice he gives is practically parallel
except for one important difference. Look at both parallel texts and see if you
can spot the difference:</p><p>Ephesians 5 vs Colossians
3</p><p>Both texts command us to
pursue a lifestyle of joyful, thankful worship "singing psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs" and giving thanks in everything. But look at what
Paul says creates that lifestyle: in Ephesians he says, "Be filled with
the Spirit," and in Colossians he says, "Let the word of Christ dwell
in you richly." </p><p>When we hold those two
texts up side by side, I think the point that we're supposed to see is: the way
to be filled with the Spirit is to let the word of Christ dwell in us, and if
we let the word of Christ dwell in us, we'll be filled with the Spirit. The two
are inseparable, parallel, and practically synonymous. You can't have one
without the other.</p><p>So, the way the Holy
Spirit will open our eyes (Ephesians 1:18) to behold Jesus and be transformed
into his likeness (2 Corinthians 3:18), is by causing his word to dwell in us
(Colossians 3:16). As we put more and more Bible into our hearts, the Holy
Spirit will stir up what we've stored up, and the result will be
transformation.</p><p>I think the reason that so
often our Christian lives are shallow, our faith is weak, and our
transformation is lacking, is because we have not stored up God's Word in our
hearts. "I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin
against you," (Psalm 119:11) the Psalmist says. The Holy Spirit has bound
himself to work through his word; if his word is not in our hearts, he doesn't
have much to work with.</p><p>Furthermore, as we've seen
over and over again in this book, the place in God's Word where his glory
shines most brightly and with the most transforming power is the cross of
Christ. We will not be transformed by vague, generally true statements like,
"Jesus loves me, this I know," even if we know that the Bible tells
us so. The way we will be transformed is by the Bible drawing our heart's
attention to specific ways, in specific verses, that Jesus loves us, and then
connecting those to specific acts of obedience.</p><p>The main reason that we should read our Bibles is in order to fill our
minds and hearts with volumes of specific ways that God loves us. That is the
meat that our souls were designed to feed on. </p><p>BORN OF BIBLE</p><p>Nothing could possibly be
more important than seeing more of Jesus and becoming more like him, and so
nothing in your schedule is more important than time in your Bible. Carve out
time in your daily routine (don't just try to "find some time" every
day; your time will fill up with less significant things and it simply won't
happen); make a plan (I'd suggest to start by reading the gospel of John or the
Psalms); and then, by God's grace, make it happen.</p><p>As this volume of Cross
Connections comes to a close, I want to give you solid encouragement to make
the Bible a regular part of your daily spiritual diet. And so I want to show
you, from God's Word, just how central the Bible is to every step of the
Christian life, and then end by connecting it all back to the cross.</p><p>How does the Christian
life begin? How do we get saved? There are multiple true ways to answer that
question, but one way to say it is that the Holy Spirit uses God's Word to wake
our hearts from the dead and cause us to be born again into a living
relationship with God. That's what Peter says in 1 Peter 1:23:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>You have been born again, not of
perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of
God.</i></p><p>The very way we become
Christians, are born again, and become spiritually alive children of God, is
"through the living and abiding word of God." James says the same
thing in a slightly different way when he gives an invitation to salvation:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Put away all filthiness and rampant
wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save
your souls.</i></p><p>Salvation is receiving
God's Word with humility and meekness, not standing in judgment over it but
letting it stand in judgment over you. That's what faith is: receiving with
meekness the saving word of God. That's what Romans 10:17 says:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Faith comes from hearing, and hearing
through the word of Christ.</i></p><p>Christians are called to
be Bible people, to live our lives feeding on the Word of God, because we are
literally born of Bible, brought to spiritual life and sustained in that
spiritual life by God's Word.</p><p>WISE FOR SALVATION</p><p>Once we have been brought
to life by the Bible, how are we then to progress in the Christian life? The
answer is: the same way you started, by receiving again again the word with
meekness, hearing the word of Christ, and believing it. In 2 Timothy 3:15-16,
our Cross Connections verse for this chapter, Paul gives us an incredible picture
of what God's Word really is, and how it functions in our lives:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>From childhood you have been
acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for
salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is breathed out by God
and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in
righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good
work.</i></p><p>These "sacred
writings," says Paul, "are able to make you wise for salvation
through faith in Christ Jesus." The phrase "wise for salvation"
literally means "wise unto salvation" or "wise, leading to final
future salvation." God's Word, which causes you to be born again into a
living relationship of faith in Jesus, is the means by which we grow in that
faith and grow in the kind of wisdom that will keep us on the pathway to
heaven.</p><p>The reason that Scripture
has that power is that it has been "breathed out by God." God's
Spirit, breathing through the inspired pens of people, created his perfect and
infallible word. I heard a poem once that said it this way: "When God
breathed on dust, he got man. When God breathed on man, he got Bible."
These words that you hold in your hand and store up in your heart are the
breath of God, the very thing that creates and sustains life. The voice that
spoke the universe into existence and spoke you into eistence spoke these
words, and still speaks through them today. </p><p>Therefore, these are no
ordinary words. The Bible is not just another book. A book like Cross
Connections might be helpful to you (I certainly hope it is!), but the only
true measure of its power and helpfulness is how closely it sticks to the words
of God. God's words have unique divine power to create spiritual life, sustain
spiritual life, and strengthen spiritual life. That's why Paul says that they
are "profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for
training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for
every good work." </p><p>These valuable, profitable
words are meant to be taught-- that means to inform the way you think so that
you will "be transformed by the renewing of your mind" (Romans 12:2).
God's words are for reproof and correction-- they are like a mirror that shows
the egg on our face and the true condition of our hearts and calls us to
repentance and obedience. God's words are for "training in
righteousness;" just like an athlete trains and grows strong by repeated
exercise, God's Word works as we repeatedly, daily, exercise the discipline of
reading it and meditating on it.</p><p>The goal of a disciplined
life of Bible reading is that so that "the man of God may be complete,
equipped for every good work." Do you realize that if the Bible isn't a
regular part of your life, that you are literally incomplete? Without the breath
of God breathing his words into our hearts, we are not all that we are supposed
to be. God's Word is the missing puzzle piece that makes us complete, equipped
for a life of cross-connected good works.</p><p>ETERNAL LIFE</p><p>The best and greatest
reason to read your Bible, however, isn't simply that it will equip you to live
the Christian life better. It's so that you can know God better. He himself is
the highest good, the greatest possible motivation. In John 17, as Jesus is
praying on the night before the crucifixion, he gives us a window into the best
news of the gospel:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>This is eternal life, that they know
you, the one true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. ~John 17:3</i></p><p>The best possible news in
the universe is that Jesus Christ lived, died, and rose, so that we could be
welcomed into an everlasting relationship with God. Jesus' death makes it
possible for me to know God-- not just know about him, but to actually know
him. "This is eternal life: to know God," Jesus says. Jesus died so
that I might have eternal life; Jesus died so that I could know God. "Let
him who boasts boast in in this, that he understands and knows me," God
says in Jeremiah 9:24. The greatest thing in the universe is to know God.</p><p>This, then, is the
greatest thing about the Bible: in its pages we come to know God himself. When
I come to the Bible, I'm coming face to face with the living God, the living
God is no longer against me but for me, the living God who died and is now alive
forever, the living God who is my Friend and Father and Shepherd and Savior
forever. </p><p>Oh Christian, don't
neglect your Bible! Jesus Christ gave up his life so that I could know God; and
I come to know him through his word. This means that when your Bible sits
collecting dust on your shelf, you are neglecting the very center of the
gospel, the very reason why Jesus bled for you. When you neglect your Bible,
you are neglecting the source of all joy, the most glorious Person in the
universe, the One for whom you were made, the One for whom you were saved. The
Bible is precious because it leads me to the One who is precious beyond all
value, who gave himself to rescue me.</p><p>So give yourself to the
study of God's Word, to knowing God's heart, to hearing his voice, to seeing
the cross connections in Scripture. Don't ever be content with what you know of
God, for he is an ocean and everything you know of him is a drop. All the joy
and glory you have experienced up until now is but a taste compared to the
everlasting feast of knowing God. We will enjoy him forever, and we get to
start now.</p><p>"God so loved the
world that he gave his only begotten Son so that whoever believes in him would
have eternal life... and this is eternal life, that they know you, the one true
God." Open up your Bible and start pressing on, then, deeper and deeper,
into the best gift of the gospel: knowing God. "Let us know, let us press
on to know the Lord" (Hosea 6:3)</p><p>Precious Bible! what a treasure</p><p>Does the Word of God afford!</p><p>All I want for life or pleasure,</p><p>Food and medicine, shield and sword:</p><p>Let the world account me poor,</p><p>Having this, I need no more.</p><p>Food to which the world's a stranger,</p><p>Here my hungry soul enjoys;</p><p>Of excess there is no danger;</p><p>Though it fills, it never cloys.</p><p>On a dying Christ I feed;</p><p>He is meat and drink indeed.</p><p>When my faith is faint and sickly,</p><p>Or when Satan wounds my mind,</p><p>Cordials, to revive me quickly,</p><p>Healing medicines, here I find.</p><p>To the promises I flee,</p><p>Each affords a remedy.</p><p>In the hour of dark temptation</p><p>Satan cannot make me yield</p><p>For the Word of consolation</p><p>Is to me a mighty shield.</p><p>While the scripture truths are sure,</p><p>From his malice I'm secure.</p><p>Vain his threats to overcome me</p><p>When I take the Spirit's sword.</p><p>Then with ease I drive him from me;</p><p>Satan trembles at the Word.</p><p>'Tis a sword for conquest made,</p><p>Keen the edge, and strong the blade.</p><p>Shall I envy then the miser,</p><p>Doting on his golden store?</p><p>Sure I am, or should be, wiser;</p><p>I am rich, 'tis he is poor;</p><p>Jesus gives me in his word</p><p>Food and medicine, shield and sword.</p><p><i></i></p><p>~John Newton</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f89353c9-2624-420a-8d7f-9cc401a4caca.jpg"></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Cross Connections- The Bible</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
