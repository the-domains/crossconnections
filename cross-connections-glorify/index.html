"Christianese" words and phrases that have been tossed around and
used repeatedly and casually until they lose all meaning, "glorify"
is probably a contender for top offender. "Glorify God" is a phrase
you'll hear a dozen times in a typical church service between the songs sung,
the Scriptures read, and sermons preached, without an attempt to ever stop and
define what "glorify God" means exactly. We say that we exist to
glorify God, but when pressed as to what that actually means, we usually can't
think beyond other tired cliches. What the Bible's command-- perhaps, even, the
Bible's central command-- means for our jobs, our classes, our friendships, our
families... well, we're just not sure. We don't quite know what glorifying God
means and looks like, and so we shouldn't be surprised that our fuzzy thinking
has led to fuzzy living, just as we've seen in this study before.</p><p>When trying to get to a
definition of "glorify," not even the dictionary helps very much.
Webster's first definition says, "to give glory to," to which I say,
thanks a lot, Captain Obvious. The second definition gets a little closer:
"to make glorious by bestowing honor, praise, or admiration."
"Bestowing honor, praise, or admiration" is a little more helpful,
but you can see the issue: when even the dictionary can't define the word
without reusing the word in its own definition, you know we've got a problem.</p><p>So before we can even
start seeing how the cross connects to this central Scriptural command, we
first have to step back and get a hold of what, exactly, it means to glorify
God.</p><p>THIS IS AWESOME</p><p>Let's define the word
"glory," and how it relates to God, and then we'll be able to tackle
"glorify." Glory, whether it relates to God or something else, means
the display of worth and value. God's glory, then, is the "going
public" of his infinite worth, the display of his value and beauty and
perfection to be admired and praised. God's glory, according to John Piper's
definition (which I think is a good, biblical one) is "the radiance of his
manifold, infinitely worthy and valuable perfections."</p><p>But let's move beyond
definitions and consider for a moment: even if you can't nail down a precise
definition, you know what glory is, because you know it when you see it. When
you stand at the rim of the Grand Canyon and feel a sweet and thrilling sense
of smallness come over you as you survey something ancient and beautiful and
huge, you are seeing and experiencing glory. When you cheer for your football
team surrounded by 50,000 other fans, see athletes perform amazing feats that
you could never hope to do, and feel the elation that comes with being swept up
into an excitement that is bigger than you, you are seeing and experiencing
glory. When you watch Lord of the Rings (or pick another epic, thrilling movie
for you non-nerds) and you see the battle lines drawn and brave men laying down
their lives for the cause of goodness and truth and freedom and you feel a tug
in your heart saying, "This is exciting! You should be like this!",
you are seeing and experiencing glory. Glory is the showcasing of something
valuable and beautiful and worthy that says, "Admire me!"</p><p>The reason that we are
drawn to visit places like the Grand Canyon, to cheer for sports teams, and to
watch epic movies, is that we were created to see and savor glory. Our hearts
yearn to admire something bigger and better than us, to be caught up into
something bigger than us, and then to go tell our friends, "The Grand
Canyon is awesome! You should go see it!" </p><p>If looking at the Grand
Canyon is seeing glory, then describing the experience to your friend and
inviting them to experience it as well is what it means to "glorify."
To glorify means to point to someone or something whose glory (in other words,
whose worth, value, or beauty) has moved you, and say, "Look at that!
Isn't that awesome! Don't you want to admire it too?" </p><p>I've purposely used a
broad definition and example like that to help you see something:
"glorifying" isn't something we just do at church, or just do when we
talk about Jesus, or even just do in relation to God. We were created to
glorify, and so we do it instinctively, with all the things we love and admire.
What you love and admire and think is worthy, valuable, or beautiful, you will
glorify.</p><p>Here's a simple way of
explaining it. I've used this to explain "glorify" to little kids
(sometimes those are the kinds of things that are most helpful to adults as
well). Imagine that every day, you're carrying around a big arrow with the
words "This is awesome!" written on it. Throughout your day, when you
are excited about something, or admire something, and you share that excitement
and admiration with others, you are pointing your arrow to that thing and
drawing attention to it. That's what "glorifying" is.</p><p>For example, everybody who
knows me knows that I have a deep and abiding passion for pizza (you've
probably picked up on that simply from the number of pizza-based illustrations
in this book). I can wax eloquent and talk at great length about the respective
merits and flavors of all the pizza chains. Friday night is pizza-and-movie
night at the Beale house-- otherwise known as the best day of the week. I
would, and could, (and, sadly, have) eaten pizza seven days a week and will
never get bored of it. I truly love and admire pizza and think it is worthy,
valuable, delicious, and yes, maybe even beautiful.</p><p>The reason that everybody
who knows me knows that I love pizza is because that arrow I carry around every
day is so often pointing at pizza. I am quick to say how much I love pizza, and
will eagerly invite others into the enjoyment of it. Many days of the week, my
life and emotions and conversations are an arrow pointing to pizza saying,
"This is awesome!"</p><p>What are you passionate
about? Music? A certain TV show? A hobby or job? A special person? The latest
electronics products (I'm guilty of that one too- ask me about the most recent
iDevice)? That which you are passionate about, you naturally talk about and
think about and enjoy and seek to share with others. That's not necessarily a
bad thing; it's the way we were created to be.</p><p>The problem is that our
"arrow" spends so much time pointing at things that, in and of
themselves, simply are not awesome. So much of our lives are dedicated to
praising and enjoying and promoting trivial things, or good things, or even
great things. But when the arrow of our life is not pointing up to God,
declaring "He is awesome!", we are malfunctioning at the very core of
what our purpose as humans is, and are failing to do what we were created to
do.</p><p>The most fundamental
reason that you and I exist is so that, by the things we do and the way we do
them, the things we say and the way we say them, the things we think and the
way we think them, the things we love and the way we love them, the arrows of
our lives would point to God and say, "He is awesome!" We exist to
admire and enjoy the beauty, worth, and value of God, and to invite others to
admire and enjoy him with us. To glorify God-- "everyone who is called by
my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made" (Isaiah
43:7)-- is why you exist.</p><p>GOD'S PASSION FOR HIS GLORY</p><p>If we are to truly
understand what the Bible says about God's glory and our purpose in glorifying
him, there is a massive truth we need to get before us: God is radically
passionate about his glory. Everything he does, he does for his glory; that is,
to display his supreme value, worth, and beauty for the admiration and
enjoyment of all creation. The reason God commands us to admire and enjoy his
supreme value, worth, and beauty, is because God admires and enjoys his supreme
value, worth, and beauty.</p><p>Does that sound selfish or
conceited to you? If I said that I admire and enjoy my value, worth, and
beauty, you could rightly call me a narcissist and despise me as such. But the
reason we know that it's bad to be self-absorbed is because we were created to
be God-absorbed. And the reason that it is right to be God-absorbed is because
God himself is God-absorbed. </p><p>I think that we're often
willing to be God-centered, as long as God is reliably man-centered. I will
live my life for God, as long as God is committed to loving me and blessing me
and saving me. All of God's actions are seen with me at the center as the
recipient and beneficiary of them. But this backwards, upside-down theology
ultimately is still self-centered; it just arrives there by different means.
Being centered on a God who is centered on me is just another way of centering
on me.</p><p>But the Bible gives us a
radically different picture of God: a God who is fully committed to the display
of his glory; who does everything out of a commitment to uphold his own value
and worth; and who, at great cost to himself, has done everything necessary to
remove every obstacle between us and himself in order to enthrall us with his
glory forever.</p><p>This theme is seen
throughout Scripture, but perhaps its most clear and condense portrayal is in
the heart of Isaiah, from chapters 40-48. This section of Isaiah resounds with
this firm declaration: "I am the LORD; that is my name; my glory I give to
no other" (Isaiah 42:8). Here are some of the God-centered glory
statements from this incredible portion of Scripture:</p><p>ISAIAH GOD-CENTEREDNESS</p><p>This is the pervasive and
unified message of Isaiah, and of the Bible: God is committed above all to
upholding and displaying the worth of his glory. As you can see from several of
those texts, all of his actions-- even his saving, loving actions towards us--
are motivated by this central passion in the heart of God. He blots out our
transgressions-- for his sake. He defers his anger from us-- for the sake of
his praise. He equips and guides-- so that all the people on earth will know
that there is none beside him. He redeems-- so that he will be glorified. This
is who our God is.</p><p>SAVED TO SEE, SAVOR, AND SHARE</p><p>This is the motivation
that stands behind the cross of Christ. At great cost to himself, the Father
put forward his Son to bear his wrath, defer his anger, and blot out
transgressions. Why? Isaiah unveils the reason: "for my name's sake,"
"for the sake of my praise." Paul tells us that "Christ became a
servant... in order that the nations might glorify God for his mercy"
(Romans 15:8-9). This is the burning motivation that Jesus himself displays the
night before the crucifixion as he is praying:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Father, the hour has come;
glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you... And now, Father, glorify me in
your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world
existed... Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with
me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me
before the foundation of the world." ~John 17:1,5,24</i></p><p>Jesus came on a mission of
glory: to glorify the Father, to glorify himself, and to purchase entrance for
us into the everlasting seeing and savoring and sharing of that glory.</p><p>We can see these twin
aims, God's glory and our salvation, come together as one in our Cross
Connection verse: "I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me"
(Psalm 50:15). In other words, God says, "I will save and rescue you, and
you will admire and enjoy my beauty, value, and worth, and invite others to
admire and enjoy me with you." </p><p>Psalm 50:15 points us to
two important truths: first, our salvation is the means by which we glorify
God; it would be impossible for us to admire and enjoy God if he doesn't take
the initiative to rescue us from our blindness and sin. God delivers us, and
the result is that we will glorify him. And second, we see in Psalm 50:15 that
glorifying God is the goal of our salvation; it is the very reason we were
saved.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>SAVED TO SEE</b></p><p>"I will deliver you,
and you will glorify me." If God does not take the initiative by first
delivering us, we will never be able or willing to glorify him. The Bible
defines our primary problem, from which we need deliverance, as a glory
problem. Romans 1, laying out its indictment against sinful humanity, says that
we have foolishly and rebelliously "exchanged the glory of the immortal
God for images" (Romans 1:23); we have exchanged the Creator for the
creation, the true God for idols, and the Masterpiece for the mirror. </p><p>A friend of mine recently
gave me a great illustration of how foolish and absurd this trade is. He
compared our exchange of God's glory for images to trading your TV for a
picture of a TV. Who would do something that dumb-- give away their brand new
TV, and hang a snapshot of it in its place? No wonder Paul says that
"claiming to be wise, they became fools;" that's a foolish trade. Or
consider another illustration that cuts right to the heart of it: it's like me
trading my wife for a picture of my wife. "I don't need my wife," I
might say, "because I've got this picture of her in my wallet!" It's
that absurd, that foolish, but that's exactly the picture that Paul gives us:
we've exchanged God's glory for empty images of it, and we think we've gotten a
good deal!</p><p>This is the essence of
sin: we prefer things over God, and are more impressed by the glory of TV, or
sports, or food, or sex, than by the glory of the infinitely glorious God.
Every other sin flowers out of this poisonous root. That's why Romans 3:23
defines sin like this: "All have sinned and fall short (or literally, in
the Greek, "lack") the glory of God." We have sinned and lack
God's glory. Of course we lack the glory of God; we have exchanged it, pawned
it off and traded it away for this world's trinkets. And that, Paul says, is
what sin is.</p><p>When you continue reading
in Romans and the rest of Scripture, it's clear that by rejecting the sweetness
and light of God's value and worth, what we get is spiritual darkness,
blindness, and emptiness. And then, to top it all off, our guilty blindness is
compounded and darkened by Satan himself. "The god of this world (Satan)
has blinded the minds of unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the
gospel of the glory of Christ" (2 Corinthians 4:4).</p><p>This is our condition
apart from divine deliverance: we have a massive glory problem. We have
exchanged the glory of God, lack the glory of God, and are therefore now blind
to the glory of God. Therefore if we are to have any hope of glorifying God--
of enjoying and admiring him and inviting others to do the same, which is what
we were created for-- we need a massive rescue. We need our sin of
glory-exchanging paid for, our eyes opened to see the beauty and worth of who
Jesus really is, and his glory replaced as the highest treasure in our hearts.
And this is exactly the rescue that God has undertaken.</p><p>Into the evil of our
glory-exchanging, which is a crime so heinous and treasonous that God regards
it as worthy of death and hell, Jesus steps forward as a wrath-absorbing
sacrifice in the place of sinners (Romans 3:23-25). Dying in our place for our
sin, he not only pays for our rebellion; he also vindicates the worth of God's
glory by demonstrating that God would rather slaughter his Son than let even
one instance of preferring creation over Creator ever go unpunished. The death
of Christ proves God's righteousness-- his upholding of the worth of his own
glory-- and God's love, and enables him to be both just and the justifier of
the one who has faith in Jesus (Romans 3:26).</p><p>Into the darkness of our
blinded condition, the Holy Spirit then undertakes to open our eyes to see the
beauty and worth of who Jesus is. We may have exchanged the light of God's
glory for darkness, and Satan may have taken our guilty darkness and made us
utterly spiritually blind, but God is in the business of overcoming blindness.
"God, who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' has shone in our hearts
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
Christ" (2 Corinthians 4:6). This is what happens when God steps in to
save someone; if you are trusting Christ today, this is what he did for you.
With the same sovereign command that lit up the universe in Genesis 1:3, God
speaks to our darkened hearts and says, "Let there be light! Blind heart,
open your eyes and see Jesus for who he really is: compelling and beautiful and
valuable and a sufficient Savior for all your sin." </p><p>When God sovereignly
speaks like this to a human heart like yours, Satan's blinders fall off, the
eyes of your heart are opened, and Jesus, whom you used to regard as boring,
irrelevant, or offensive, no longer appears that way. You see him for who he
really is, see that he's true and real and sufficient and glorious, grasp the
gospel's good news for the first time, and freely and irresistibly claim him as
your Savior. For some, this comes as a dramatic revelation, like Saul getting
knocked off his horse and coming to face to face with the risen Christ. For
others, like me, it involves the lights slowly coming on in the heart. I can't
pinpoint the moment when my heart first saw and embraced Jesus. All I know is,
"I was blind but now I see" (John 9:25). And the only reason I saw
him, and thus the only reason I embraced him, is that God sovereignly spoke
into my heart with unblinding authority and grace. All of my salvation, and all
of my current standing before him, is owing to the way he graciously,
gloriously delivered me. It all started in his heart and was accomplished by
his power, for his purposes of glorifying himself-- of demonstrating that he
alone is able to save, that he alone is merciful and mighty. Lest we think it
was our own cleverness or spirituality that made us receptive to the gospel,
properly understanding how we were saved preserves God's glory at the center of
salvation. The only thing we contribute to our salvation is the sin from which
we need to be rescued.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>SAVED TO SAVOR AND SHARE</b></p><p>While glory is the central
issue in salvation, the gospel is so much bigger than just being rescued from
our glory-exchanging ways. Let's go back and look again at what Jesus prayed in
John 17:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Father, I desire that they
also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that
you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the
world."~John 17:24</i></p><p>Jesus' prayer, which is a
prayer that the Father delights to answer, is that we would one day finally be
with him, to see his glory. The ultimate goal of the gospel is John 17:24--
that we, with our eyes opened to the beauty of Jesus' glory and our hearts
changed to love his glory-- would be welcomed into an eternity of seeing,
savoring, and celebrating that glory. John Piper has much to say about that;
the following is a quote worth reading in its entirety and meditating at length
on:</p><p>"The best news of the
Christian gospel is that the supremely glorious Creator of the universe has
acted in Jesus Christ's death and resurrection to remove every obstacle between
us and himself so that we may find everlasting joy in seeing and savoring his
infinite beauty. The saving love of God is his doing whatever must be done, at
great cost to himself, and for the least deserving, so that he might enthrall
them with what will make them supremely happy forever, namely, himself.
Therefore, the gospel of God and the love of God are expressed finally and
fully in God's gift of himself for our everlasting pleasure. 'In your presence
there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore (Psalm
16:11).'"</p><p>There is a lot of good
news in the gospel-- forgiveness of sins, justification, eternal life. But
those are all means to this end: every obstacle removed between us and the One
we were made to see and savor and share forever. Forgiveness removes the sins
that have made a separation between you and God (Isaiah 59:2), so that you can
return to God. Justification gives you the blessing of perfect, right standing
with God... so that you can joyfully say, "Since we have been justified by
faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we
also have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand, and
we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God" (Romans 5:1-2). And eternal
life is simply the full and final enjoyment of what Jesus prayed for: "I
desire that they may be with me where I am, to see my glory."</p><p>I believe that this is the
most significant key to a life that glorifies God: knowing that God has rescued
you so that you can take great delight in his glory. Remember, glorifying God
(or glorifying anything else for that matter) means pointing to something or
someone whose worth and beauty has moved you and saying, "Look! Isn't that
awesome? Don't you want to admire it with me?" </p><p>It's one thing to say that
about God with our lips. But it is a far more powerful testament to the beauty,
worth, and value of God when people see, by the way we respond to God and talk
about God and order our lives and value our possessions, that he is our supreme
Treasure. God doesn't want you to just say, "God is glorious." He
wants you to savor his glory, to respond to him as the most valuable reality in
the universe, and then live like that's true, like he's really better than
pizza and family and houses and cars and success and popularity. If Jesus
Christ is more precious to me than all those things, that will change the way I
relate to those things, the way I talk about them, and the way I talk about
him. </p><p>And you know what? People
will see that. People will see your different values system on full display
when you face loss or disappointment and can confidently say, "My flesh
and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion
forever" (Psalm 73:26). The great worth of Jesus will be clear to people
when you make choices that seem crazy to them; when you give sacrificially to
advance his kingdom, when you sacrifice your time to make him known, when you
leave your job and family and comfortable life to take his gospel and glory to
the nations. If his "steadfast love is better than life" (Psalm
63:3), and we have tasted and seen that his glory is what satisfies our souls,
then the choices we make will make that evident. What we truly love and admire
and think is beautiful and valuable-- that is what we will glorify.</p><p>The call to glorify God is
the call to let your life be like the lens of a telescope (hence the icon for this
chapter). A telescope makes faint, faraway objects appear more like they really
are. For most people, God and his glory is like a star in the night sky; at
best, he's a faint twinkle on the horizon and periphery of their life. What
they need is to see his reality in our lives, to put their eyes to the lens of
our lives and see that God's glory is not small and faint and irrelevant, but
massive and spectacular and weighty and beautiful. And it is only when we are
affected and moved and awed by his glory and grace that our lives will become
the telescopes they were designed to be.</p><p>LIVING TO PROVE HIS LOVE IS BETTER THAN
LIFE</p><p>Since glorifying God means
admiring and enjoying God as the most valuable reality in the universe and
inviting others to join you, the heart of glorifying God is believing that
Psalm 63:3 is true, and living like it: "Because your steadfast love is better
than life, my lips will praise you." Glorifying God starts with believing
and experiencing God's steadfast love to truly be better-- more valuable, more
precious-- than life itself and everything that life has to offer. Because if
that's really true-- if God's love, and God's love alone, outweighs every
blessing and joy this life has to offer-- that will have radical, transforming
implications for how we live. Glorifying God, then, means living to prove that
his love is better than life. Think for a moment of all the things you love in
this world, all the good things, and all the things that draw your attention
and consume your time. What would it mean if you really believed that
experiencing and seeing and possessing and sharing God's steadfast love was better
than all of those things? </p><p>Would you care quite so
much what other people thought of you especially as it related to sharing the
life-changing news of God's saving, steadfast love with them? If we really
believed Psalm 63:3, then our lips and our lives would have one message to
those around you: "His steadfast love is better than popularity."</p><p>How would you think about
and use money, if all your money was just a means to savor and spread the news
of God's infinite worth? Would entertainment and comfort be the priorities
people would see in your budget, or would God's purposes and God's kingdom and
sacrificial generosity shine? If we really believed Psalm 63:3, our wallets and
budgets would proclaim, "His steadfast love is better than money!" </p><p>If "better is one day
in your courts than a thousand elsewhere" (Psalm 84:10), what would that
mean for the way you spent your time, and scheduled your days, and the
priorities you have? Would your calendar demonstrate to people that you are the
center of your life, or would it suggest that God's purposes are what you love
most? If we invested our moments and our days in savoring his glory and making
his glory known, maybe then our calendars would shout to everyone who saw them,
"His steadfast love is better than life!"</p><p>This is where the
"rubber" of glory meets the "road" of your life. Your
friends and family and co-workers and relationships have been given to you so
that you might live with them in such a way that demonstrates that they are not
your treasure; Jesus is your treasure. Your money has been given to you so that
you might spend it in a way that demonstrates that money is not your treasure;
Jesus is your Treasure. Your days and weeks and years have been given to you so
that you might use them in such a way that demonstrates that they are not your
treasure; Jesus is your Treasure.</p><p>When this becomes the
heartbeat of our lives-- "Your steadfast love is better than life!"--
then our lips and wallets and calendars and relationships will begin to do what
they were created to do: sing his praise. And our lives will become telescope
lenses, in which the world can see the glorious, precious, weighty reality of
Jesus Christ, whose love is better than life.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Father, You are glorious-- valuable, weighty,
worthy, beautiful-- beyond all compare. Open my eyes day by day to see more of
you in your Word and in your world, so that my heart will be thrilled with that
which is most thrilling. Forgive me for loving trinkets more than you, the
supreme Treasure of the universe. Reorient my values system until you become my
highest Good, so that everyone who meets me will see that you are worthy of
love and honor and praise. </i></p><picture>
