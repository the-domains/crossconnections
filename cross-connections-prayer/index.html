grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
~Hebrews 2:16</i></b></p><p>As we come to the last two
Cross Connections chapters in this book (although certainly not the last two
cross connections in the Bible by any stretch!), we'll tackle the two central
disciplines of the Christian life: prayer and Bible reading. These two together
are the vital breath of living faith; the Christian life inhales Scripture and
exhales prayer. Together, they create and sustain the Christian life. And they
both have everything to do with the cross.</p><p>What I've learned through
my own experience and through watching the lives of other believers, is that
most of us tend to lean toward one or the other, instead of embracing them
both. We tend to either be Bible people, or prayer people. I, for one, am
completely unqualified to write this chapter; my prayer life is weak and shaky at
best. I'm one of those people whose quiet times gravitate towards Bible and
away from prayer, and my walk with God suffers as a result. I have not met many
Christians who are deeply and passionately committed to both-- and those whom I
have met are the deepest, wisest, strongest believers I have known.</p><p>The reason that we need to
cultivate a life of Bible-saturation and constant prayer is that these two
disciplines need each other to function properly. Bible reading that is not
accompanied by prayerful meditation will quickly either become dry and academic
or derailed by false interpretations. The Holy Spirit uses God's Word most
effectively in our lives when the sword of the Spirit is sharpened regularly by
prayer.</p><p>Similarly, prayer will
quickly turn ingrown and disconnected from God's will and purposes when it
ceases to be tethered to a steady diet of God's Word. 1 John 5:14 gives us the
recipe for successful and answered prayer: "If we ask anything according
to his will he hears us." And how do we know his will and keep our hearts
and minds fixed on it? By filling our minds and hearts with his word. A heart
overflowing with God's Word will pray God's will.</p><p>THE IMPORTANCE OF PRAYER</p><p>The reality of the vital
importance of prayer has been proven again and again by saints through history.
I want to share some of their observations and experiences with you, to whet
your appetite for a life devoted to prayer. These giants of the faith have
walked long and deep with God, and have returned to share what they have
learned with us. And what they have learned is remarkably simple: prayer is of
vital importance.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Prayer doesn't fit us for the greater work--
prayer is the greater work."</i></p><p>
~Oswald Chambers, early twentieth century evangelist and teacher, and author of
My Utmost For His Highest</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Prayer is the vital breath of the Christian;
not the thing that makes him alive, but the evidence that he is alive."</i></p><p> ~Oswald Chambers</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"Prayer-- secret, fervent, believing prayer--
lies at the root of all personal godliness." </i></p><p>~William Carey, pioneer missionary to India in the
1700s and father of the modern missions movement</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"I used to think that prayer should have the
first place and teaching the second. I now feel it would be truer to give
prayer the first, second and third places and teaching the fourth."</i></p><p>~James
O. Fraser, pioneer missionary to China in the early twentieth century</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"A sinning man will stop praying.</i></p><p><i>A praying man will stop sinning."</i></p><p>~Leonard
Ravenhill, evangelist and author of Why Revival Tarries</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"The one concern of the devil is to keep the
saints from prayer.</i></p><p><i>He fears nothing
from prayerless studies, prayerless work, prayerless religion.</i></p><p><i>He laughs at our toil, he mocks at our
wisdom, but he trembles when we pray."</i></p><p>~Jonathan Edwards, pastor and
theologian during the First Great Awakening</p><p>These are but a few
testimonies to the vital importance of prayer. We could go back further and
read the medieval mystics who walked with God in an age when the church had
grown cold and formal, and hear them joyfully recount their experiences in
prayer. We could press back further still to the early church fathers who
helped to guide God's people through persecution and fought for the central
truths of the gospel, and listen in on their rich prayer life (Saint Augustine's
Confessions is a book-long prayer!). Or perhaps it would do us well to simply
listen to God's Word and heed its command:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Rejoice always; pray without ceasing;
give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
for you. ~1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</i></p><p>Prayer-- whether it takes
the form of praise or thankfulness or intercession or request-- is the living
relationship between us and God. How does your life measure up against the
command of 1 Thessalonians 5:1-- "pray without ceasing?" If your
life, like mine, falls far short of that ideal of constant, intimate fellowship
with the Father, don't despair-- but start repenting and striving to change.
John Dalyrmple, who lived in the 1700s, said this about that verse: "The truth
is that we only learn to pray all the time everywhere after we have resolutely
set about praying some of the time somewhere."</p><p>THE CROSS AND YOUR PRAYER LIFE</p><p>The most important thing
that I think we need in our pursuit of fuller prayer lives, however, is not
better examples or sterner lectures or even practical suggestions. All of those
are good and helpful, but what I believe will really change our lives is the
gospel. Just like every other area of the Christian life, our praying is meant
to be motivated, shaped, and guided by the cross. Our grasp on how the gospel
relates to prayer is fuzzy, and so our prayer life is fuzzy. So, to build a
clear and vibrant life of prayer, we need to start by building a gospel-driven
theology of prayer.</p><p>THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF
PRAYER</p><p>The first thing we need to
see when approaching the topic of prayer via the gospel is that prayer is
impossible. What I mean by that is, sinners have no right to talk to God, no
access to approach him, and no reason to expect anything from him. Isaiah 59:2
lays out the fundamental problem we have in prayer:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Your iniquities have made a
separation between you and God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so
that he does not hear.</i></p><p>We are separated from God
because of our sins, and in response to our prayers, the gates of heaven are
locked shut. As sinners and rebels, we have no access to the King. Many
unbelievers have told me that they pray every day; while this might be true,
the uncomfortable and tragic reality is that they aren't praying to the true
God-- they have no access to him.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>ACCEPTABLE THROUGH JESUS</b></p><p>So how do sinners like you
and me have any hope of being able to pray to God? The answer is simple and
profound. 1 Peter 2:5 says that our spiritual sacrifices-- all our worship,
service, and prayers-- are "acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
The only way that a sinner's prayers will be heard in the throne room of heaven
is if they come to the Father through Jesus. He is the One who bridged the
great divide, suffered to forgive our sins, and opened the way for us to draw
near to God. </p><p>That's why unbelievers do
not have access to God through prayer; they are not approaching the throne
through faith in Jesus. Muslims pray devotedly five times a day; their prayers
are not heard in heaven, because their spiritual sacrifices are not acceptable
to God through Jesus Christ. A billion Hindus pray earnestly to their gods, but
those idols can neither hear nor save. Your "spiritual" friend or
co-worker may pray every day, but unless she comes to God through faith in
Jesus, her separation from God remains, and heaven's doors are closed.</p><p>We need to know this
reality and feel its sober truth, so that the gospel's gift of free and
unfettered access to the throne of God will land on our hearts as indescribably
wonderful. The fact that you and I-- weak, failing, faithless sinners-- have
had heaven's doors thrown open and been ushered into the throne room is
unspeakable grace. What we take for granted every time we pray comes to us at
an unfathomable cost. Our access-- so free for us-- has been been purchased by
the blood of Jesus. "Through him we have obtained access by faith into
this grace in which we now stand" (Romans 5:2).</p><p>Separation between a holy
God and unholy sinners was built into the way God related to his people in the
Old Testament, and serves as a beautiful picture to help us understand what
Jesus has accomplished for us. In the Old Testament, people had to come to the
temple to meet with God, and even then, they weren't able to actually enter
into the Holy Place in the temple; only consecrated priests could do that. But
even those consecrated priests couldn't enter into the Most Holy Place, where
God had promised that his presence would dwell. The Most Holy Place was
shielded from view by a thick curtain, keeping the people's unholiness and sin
separate from the perfect presence of God. Only the high priest could enter the
Most Holy Place, and only once a year, and he had to bring a sacrifice of blood
in order to enter and survive his encounter with God.</p><p>Have that picture in your
mind as you approach the scene of the crucifixion in Mark 15 and witness the
moment of Jesus' death:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed
his last. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
~Mark 15:37-38</i></p><p>At the moment of his
death, the curtain that separated the holy presence of God from the unholiness
of the people was torn in two-- a picture that shouts, "Access to the holy
presence of God is now open! Approach the throne of grace!" Jesus' death
opens the way for us to enter through the torn curtain and approach the
presence of God. When you close your eyes and pray in Jesus' name, you are
doing something unthinkable in the old covenant; you are coming right to the
throne of God and making your request face to face with your Father. Listen to
how Hebrews 10 describes what Jesus did for us, and its implications:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Therefore, brothers, since we have
confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, by the new and
living way he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh,
and since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a
true heart in full assurance of faith. ~Hebrews 10:19-22</i></p><p>We now have confidence to
enter the holy places, to approach God in worship and prayer, because of the
blood of Jesus. Hebrews says that "the new and living way he opened for
us" through that Old Testament curtain is his flesh; in other words, every
time we approach God, we are approaching him through the pierced hands and torn
flesh of the Savior. He is our access to God. As Ephesians 2:18 says,
"Through him we have access in one Spirit to the Father."</p><p>Because of Jesus-- only
because of what he has done for us-- we now have confidence to approach God in
prayer. There are no formulas or "right words" to say; no amount of
"Hail Marys" make your prayers acceptable to God. Your prayers do not
qualify because of anything you do or don't do; whether or not you sinned a lot
or a little today neither assures you access nor hinders your approach to the
throne. A lot times, when I've stumbled into the same pattern of sin for the
umpteenth time, I feel hesitant coming back to God. I know I've messed up
again, and I feel the dirtiness of my sin. But the good news of the gospel is
that the door to heaven's throne room always stands open to me, and my
confidence is not based on my success or failure, but on Jesus' blood shed for
me.</p><p>We need to know this
truth, because I think that far too often we base our relationship with God on
how well we do, instead of on what Jesus has done for us. When I fall into the
same sin for the ten thousandth time, my confidence and assurance is shaken,
and so I stop praying, and my heart goes cold. Or, conversely, when I'm doing
"well," I'm much more eager to come to God in prayer and worship. If
that's your experience-- hot and cold, up and down-- it's a good indication
that you're trusting in your performance instead of Jesus' perfect blood and
righteousness.</p><p>The truth is, even my best
days, best deeds, and best prayers are shot through with sinful thoughts and
motives. My best deeds are enough to disqualify me from approaching God, and
enough to condemn me. But I don't have to approach God on the basis of what
I've done; I get to approach him on the basis of what Jesus has done for me.
Here's how John Owen, a Puritan pastor and theologian put it:</p><p>"Believers obey
Christ as the one by whom our obedience is accepted by God. Believers know all
their duties are weak, imperfect and unable to abide in God's presence.
Therefore they look to Christ as the one who bears the iniquity of their holy
things, who adds incense to their prayers, gathers out all the weeds from their
duties, and makes them acceptable to God."</p><p>All of my obedience is
acceptable to God only because it comes to him through Jesus. His shed blood
covers every imperfection and sin, "adds incense to my prayers,"
gathers out all the weeds of impure motives from my best duties, and makes
everything that I do acceptable to God. This is one of the great gospel hopes
that I have in prayer.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>MY HOPE: HIS PRAYERS, NOT MINE</b></p><p>Jesus secures my free and
undeserved access to God, but he does even more than that. The greatest gospel
hope that I have is not, ultimately, that my prayers are accepted by the
Father, but that Jesus himself is praying for me. Romans 8:34 celebrates this
incredible truth:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is
the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of
God, </i></p><p><i><b>who indeed is interceding for us.</b></i></p><p>Right now, at this moment,
the risen and ascended Christ is interceding for us; that is, he is standing
before the Father's throne as our representative and advocate, praying for us,
pleading the merit of his shed blood, and securing all of heaven's blessing and
power on our behalf. Hebrews 7:24-25 says that our great high priest, Jesus
himself, stands before God, alive forever and always praying for us:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>He holds his priesthood permanently,
because he continues forever. Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost
those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make
intercession for them.</i></p><p>Richard Foster, who wrote
one of the great modern devotional classics on prayer, wrote this about that
verse: "The writer to the Hebrews reminds us that Jesus Christ is our
Great High Priest and, as you know, the function of the High Priest in ancient
Israel was to intercede before God on behalf of the people. Do we realize what
this means? Today, as we carry on the activities of our lives, Jesus Christ is
praying for us."</p><p>Robert Murray M'Cheyne, a
great nineteenth century missionary, adds this: "If I could hear Christ
praying for me in the next room, I would not fear a million enemies. Yet
distance makes no difference; he is praying for me."</p><p>Do you feel the weight of
glory and comfort that this incredible truth imparts? Today, right at this
moment, Jesus Christ is praying for you. He carries you on his heart in the
throne room of heaven, and he "always lives to make intercession" for
me. When all my prayers fail, when words cannot come, when I don't even know
what to pray for, Jesus Christ is praying for me. His commitment to pray for me
is greater than my commitment to pray to him-- and yet he never wavers, never
changes, never becomes unfaithful to those who he has bought with his blood.</p><p>This is why I believe in
the perseverance of the saints-- I believe in the perseverance of Jesus'
prayers for me. Paul believes this too; look at the breathtaking implication he
draws from Jesus' intercession in Romans 8:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is
the one who died-- more than that, who was raised-- who is at the right hand of
God, who indeed is interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
nakedness, or danger, or sword?... No, in all these things we are more than
conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life,
nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor
height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate
us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i></p><p>Nothing will separate me
from Jesus' love, because nothing will separate me from Jesus' prayers. He died
for me, he lives for me, and now he pleads for me-- therefore, I am and most
assuredly will be more than a conqueror because of his saving, praying love for
me. I love what Charles Spurgeon says about Jesus' prayers for me:</p><p>"We little know what
we owe to our Savior's prayers. When we reach the hilltops of heaven and look
back upon all the way whereby the Lord our God has led us, how we shall praise
him who, before the eternal throne, undid the mischief which Satan was doing on
earth. How we shall thank him because he never held his peace, but day and
night pointed to the wounds upon his hands, and carried our names upon his
breastplate."</p><p>What confidence we have
because of Jesus!</p><p>IF GOD IS FOR US</p><p>There is one more massive
thing we have to see about how the cross relates to how we pray, in order to
have the rock-solid confidence in prayer that God intends for us. We've seen
how "we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of
Jesus." We've seen Jesus "lives to make intercession" for us as
our great high priest. The last thing I want us to see is the massive promise
of answered prayer that God makes on the basis of Jesus' death.</p><p>In Romans 8, Paul has been
leading us up into the heights of God's eternal purposes for his people. Some
of the most precious promises in the Bible are in this chapter: "There is
no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (8:1); "the
sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that
will be revealed to us" (8:18); "for those who love God, all things
work together for good" (8:28); and more. In verse 31-32, Paul reaches the
pinnacle of this "Mount Everest" of good news:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>What then shall we say to these
things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own
Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give
us all things?</i></p><p>This has been called the
biggest promise in the entire Bible; it reaches down into the eternal, unfathomable
heart of God, reaches out to encompass all of creation, and is anchored in the
center of God's revelation: the cross.</p><p>Follow heaven's logic in
verse 32: "He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all,
how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?" This is an
argument from the greater to the lesser (if you want to get technical, the
formal term of this argument is "a fortiori"). The argument goes, if
you were able to do a difficult thing, then you can logically expect to be able
to do something comparably easier. For example, "If I can lift this box of
books, then of course I can lift a box of Cheerios." If I can do the hard
thing, it logically follows that I can do the comparatively easy thing.</p><p>Here's how the argument in
Romans 8:32 works: If God showed the greatest possible love and did the most
difficult thing by paying the highest possible cost to surrender that which was
most precious to him-- namely, the life of his Son-- how much more, then, can
we expect him to do that which is comparatively small and light and easy-- that
is, give us everything else we need? If he didn't spare his own Son but freely
gave him up for us all, then of course he'll freely give us all the other
little things we need, like answered prayer. The cross stands not just as proof
of God's love, but as proof of his loving commitment to give us absolutely
everything we need. Because of Jesus' death, God is our heavenly Father and God
is for us... and if God is for us, who could possibly successfully be against
us? The answer: no one! </p><p>This is the confidence
that we have to approach God boldly in prayer. Our Cross Connections verse from
Hebrews 4 says it this way:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Since we have a great high priest who
has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our
confession... Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace,
that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</i></p><p>If all these promises--
that all our prayers and obedience is acceptable to God through Jesus, that
Christ himself is praying for us, that all of God's heart is committed to our
everlasting good, and that the throne of heaven is for us a throne of grace--
are ours in Christ, how can we not set our hearts to pray eagerly and confidently?
John Newton's encouraging words are exactly what the gospel tells us to
believe:</p><p>Behold the throne of
grace;</p><p>The promise calls us near;</p><p>There Jesus shows a
smiling face</p><p>And waits to answer
prayer.</p><p>That rich atoning blood,</p><p>Which sprinkled round we
see,</p><p>Provides for those who
come to God</p><p>An all prevailing plea.</p><p>My soul, ask what thou
will,</p><p>Thou cannot be too bold;</p><p>Since his own blood for
thee he spilt,</p><p>What else can he
withhold?</p><p>What else, indeed, could
he withhold? He has given us himself, he has granted us access, he has given us
everything we need for life and godliness and devoted prayer. Let's not let the
guilty remembrance of past sin or current failures hold us back; sin no longer
has the power to keep us from the throne of grace. </p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Father, How can I even begin to express my
thankfulness for all that you have done for me through your Son Jesus? Thank
you for doing the most difficult thing possible-- surrendering your Son for
me-- so that I could know your love and presence and fellowship. Help me not to
take for granted the precious gospel gift of access to your throne of grace;
rather, help me, by your Spirit, to cultivate a life of prayer and dependence
on you.</i></p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="23"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="25"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="26"><span data-reactid="27"><!-- react-empty: 28 --><h2 data-reactid="29"><a data-reactid="30">CrossConnections</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="31"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="33"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="34"></div></section></div></div>
