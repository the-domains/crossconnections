going on in many of our Christian lives. On one hand, we know the gospel-- the
good news that because Jesus died and rose to forgive our sins, all who trust
in him receive eternal life. We know the gospel is how we "get
saved;" we repent of our sins and trust in Christ, and we are
"in," so to speak.</p><p>On the other hand,
however, we know that there are things that Christians are supposed to do.</p><p>We're saved by grace, but once we're in the
door, we find out that Christians are supposed to love each other, and forgive
grievances, and be humble, and thankful, and joyful, etc etc. </p><p>So in one hand, there's
free grace, forgiveness, and eternal life.</p><p>In the other hand is duty and obedience and holiness and sanctification.
Do you feel the tension? Once you believe in Jesus, how are you supposed to
live? You're told that there is a difference in how you're supposed to live
now, and you feel the difference in your own soul; God has changed you, and
you're not the same person you used to be. But now that you've been saved by
grace, it's up to you to "live it out," right?</p><p>This is the great
disconnect in our Christian lives- the two halves of the Christian life, in
each of our hands, and we don't know how they go together. And when we don't
know how the two halves go together, we usually end up emphasizing one over the
other.</p><p>Different people do this;
different churches do this; I do this.</p><p>It's natural.</p><p>And it's deadly
wrong.</p><p>There are three mistakes
you can make with how the two halves of the Christian lif relate, and two of
them are very common.</p><p>Some people, in
their zeal to preserve and uphold the good news of the gospel and the free gift
of God's grace, emphasize the first part of the Christian life- the gospel.</p><p>They emphasize grace, grace, grace. They love
the cross.</p><p>They love that all their sins
have been forgiven. But then they sort of just... stop.</p><p>The Bible talks about growing in godliness,
growing in the knowledge of God, growing in personal holiness. But they just
sort of stay at the front door, saying, "Jesus loves me, this I
know," and they never start doing the hard work of discipline and
discipleship that Jesus calls us to.</p><p>Or even worse, sometimes
the emphasis on free grace subtly turns into a free pass to sin. "If God
will just forgive me, then it doesn't matter what I do," is how it usually
goes.</p><p>Even if they don't come out and
say it like that, it's generally how they operate: God always forgives me, so
sin must not be that big of a deal.</p><p>They've forgotten what Paul says in Romans 6, after spending the first 5
chapters extolling the free grace of God: "Are we to continue in sin so
that grace may abound? By no means!"</p><p>There's another mistake,
however, on the other end of the spectrum. These people love obedience.</p><p>Following God's commands and growing in
holiness is important to them. They want to please God in their daily
lives.</p><p>And so... they work really hard.
They deny themselves. They read their Bibles and go to church. But in the process,
they don't think too much about grace and the cross.</p><p>They prayed that prayer when they were six,
but now the Christian life is about obedience. But now, they have a tendency to
rest in their own achievements, to be secure in God's love because they've
obeyed him (or conversely, deeply shaken when they mess up), and to measure
their worth primarily by how they've measured up.</p><p>But just like the first
group of people, it can get worse on this end of the spectrum too.</p><p>It's possible to pay so much attention to the
"duty" side of the Christian life that you can completely forget
about grace.</p><p>Salvation becomes about
works.</p><p>You have to measure up to God,
and other people have to measure up to you.</p><p>You tend to look down on other, "weaker" people, and shake
your head and cluck your tongue at "those people" who do the things
you would never do.</p><p>But in falling off
the "legalism" end of the spectrum, these people end up becoming the
very thing that Jesus railed against: pharisees.</p><p>He said of them, "They tie up heavy
burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves
are not willing to move the with their finger. They do all their deeds to be
seen by others."</p><p>So on one end of the
spectrum, you get "Christians" who look just like the rest of the
world- they sin just as much, but pat themselves on the back and say, "But
God forgives me."</p><p>On the other end
of the spectrum, you get "Christians" who are legalistic, uptight
hypocrites who look down on everyone else. Neither extreme is what we're aiming
for. But that fuzzy area of leaning one way or another is where most of us
live.</p><p>There is another mistake
people make in trying to hold both halves of the Christian life together.</p><p>This one gets closer at the truth but still
misses it.</p><p>These Christians, on one
hand, want to love the gospel, always remember the cross, and be ever-mindful
of God's mercy to them.</p><p>On the other
hand, they want to grow in personal holiness and godliness.</p><p>So... they try to do both.</p><p>They get up early and read their Bibles and
go to church and try to do the right thing.</p><p>And when they fail, they remind themselves of grace and forgiveness, and
then try again.</p><p>You can see why this is a lot closer to the
truth.</p><p>Of course we should hold fast to
the gospel.</p><p>And of course we should
strive for personal holiness. And yet, it doesn't really get rid of the error
of either approach: your personal holiness is still primarily effort-based, and
the gospel is basically your fall-back.</p><p>"I'm going to try really hard to obey God, but I know grace will
catch me when I fall." It sounds
good. It's so close to being right. But it's still dangerously wrong.</p><p>But there is a fourth
approach, and I believe that this is the approach that the Bible itself calls
for.</p><p>In short, the gospel in one hand is
supposed to motivate and empower the obedience in the other hand.</p><p>That sounds great of course; but practically
speaking, how does that work?</p><p>The key lies in what I call "cross
connections;" lines of motivation drawn between the gospel in one hand and
obedience in the other hand. You see, most people see the cross over on one
side, and all of our obedience over on the other side. </p><p>There's the gospel, and
there's an unrelated constellation of different things we're supposed to do.
What we so often fail to realize, however, is that the Bible itself doesn't
look at things like that.</p><p>The obedience
over on the right is never disconnected from the cross over on the left.</p><p>In fact, over and over again, the biblical
authors draw lines straight from the cross over to specific acts of
obedience.</p><p>For example, here's a
relatively obvious one (that will be unpacked more later): "Beloved, if
God so loved us, we ought to love one another" (1 John 4:11). Do you see
how it works? There's the gospel and the cross- God so loved us. And there's
our obedience- love one another.</p><p>And
there's the connection- if God loved us like this, then we have an obligation
to love each other the same way. </p><p>These are what I call
"cross connections," and once you start to notice them, you'll
quickly realize that they're everywhere. And I really mean everywhere.</p><p>Back in college, when I was first discovering
these things in the Bible for myself, I got rather overexcited and made a rash,
sweeping declaration: "Every single thing that Christians are called to
do, believe, or be, is somewhere in a verse or passage explicitly tied to the
cross."</p><p>Now, that's the kind of
wild, universally sweeping declaration that college students like to make.</p><p>But here's the thing.</p><p>In the years since then, as I've continued to
search the Scriptures, I haven't been able to prove myself wrong.</p><p>It really does seem like everything-
absolutely everything- that Christian are called to do, believe, or be is
explicitly linked to the atonement, to the cross, just like in 1 John 4:11.</p><p>"Everything?"
you say. "Surely you can't mean everything."</p><p>Well, until I find an exception, I mean
everything.</p><p>























Every single one of those
things is explicitly and specifically tied logically or motivationally to the
fact that Jesus died for you.Every
single one.Once you see this for
yourself, everything changes.Because
the Christian life was not designed to be lived, on one hand, as pure
obedience.But the Christian life was
not designed to be lived simply resting in the gospel either.The Christian life was designed to be lived
in these cross connections.God's will
for you is to live your life in these connections-- "walk in love <b>as Christ loved us</b></p><p> and gave himself up
for us;" "welcome one another </p><p><b>as
Christ has welcomed you</b></p><p>;" "Christ suffered for you, </p><p><b>leaving you an example</b></p><p>, so that you
might follow in his steps." </p><p>These cross connections
are the high voltage power lines connecting from the gospel (which is "the
power of God"-- Romans 1:16) to the efforts of holiness in your life.</p><p>Our problem has been that we've been trying
to plug the various appliances of obedience into outlets other than the
gospel-- outlets like duty ("this is what you're commanded to do") or
guilt ("you should do better!") or people pleasing ("everyone
will see what a good Christian you are") or emotions ("I really love
Jesus today, so I'm going to try harder"). But these outlets don't provide
enough power to fuel our obedience. But once these cross connections are made
to specific areas in your life, the gospel will start functioning the way God
intended it to-- driving and motivating and empowering and leading and shaping
all of your obedience.</p><p>Before we launch into the
rest of this study and start looking at these specific cross connections, I
want to do three more things in this two-part introduction. First I want to
show you, from the Bible, why I believe that this is how God intends for the
gospel to function in our lives. Then, in the second part of the introduction,
I want to give you a crucial piece of advice to help you start seeing these
Cross Connections for yourself in the Bible. And third, I want to unpack how
exactly these Cross Connections work, so that you'll be prepared to start
applying them.</p><p>THE CENTRALITY OF THE CROSS</p><p>At the outset of this
study, I don't want you to take my word for any of this. If this isn't how
God's Word portrays the gospel and the Christian life, then this is just
another error to add to the pile. But I do believe that this is how the Bible
links the gospel and the Christian life, and I want to show you one text in
particular that makes this case.</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 15, after
14 chapters of working with the wayward church in Corinth, Paul wants to remind
them of the gospel. That in and of itself is important to note- coming to the
end of 14 chapters of urgent exhortation on sin and holiness, Paul didn't want
to remind them of their duty to God; he wanted to remind them of God's
grace.</p><p>But the way that he reminds them
of the gospel connects back to everything he said in the first 14 chapters.</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>Now I would remind you, brothers, of
the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by
which you are being saved. </i></p><p><i>~1
Corinthians 15:1-2</i></p><p>He said,
"Corinthians, I want to remind you of the gospel"- and then reminded
them of three specific things about their relationship with that gospel. It was
the gospel "which you received," "in which you stand," and
"by which you are being saved."</p><p>Those three ways that Christians are to relate to the gospel are the
foundation of the Christian life.</p><p>Let's
take each of them one by one.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE GOSPEL WHICH YOU RECEIVED</b></p><p>Paul reminds these
struggling Christians that the good news of free grace purchased by Jesus'
death and resurrection was something they had received.</p><p>Before the gospel is anything else to us, it
is first news to be received and believed.</p><p>If you haven't received the gospel-- that is, if you haven't responded
to the grace of God by turning from your sin and trusting in Jesus-- then
you're not yet a Christian.</p><p>You might
have gone to church every Sunday for your entire life, but that doesn't make
you a Christian, any more than going to a garage makes you a car.</p><p>Where you go on Sunday isn't what's
ultimately important; what you receive is.</p><p>"The gospel which you
received" is how most Christians think of the gospel: news to be received
and believed.</p><p>Perhaps it's what you
heard when you were eight years old in Sunday School, and God's Spirit moved on
you and you prayed and asked Jesus to come into your heart. Perhaps, like me,
you received it for the first time as a twelve-year-old in confirmation class
as the Holy Spirit opened your eyes to see that Jesus is more than a historical
footnote, but is a beautiful, compelling, living, saving Savior. Maybe you
heard the gospel from a friend in college, and as God opened your heart to
respond, suddenly the Bible wasn't foolishness but was urgent and true and
real.</p><p>Maybe you had a spectacular
conversion story like the apostle Paul.</p><p>Maybe your conversion was more like the lights slowly coming on.</p><p>Either way, the gospel is what you first
received.</p><p>The moment you trusted
Christ and received the gospel, something incredible happened to you: the God
of the universe, the Holy King and Righteous Judge, declared you "not
guilty" with all of your sin nailed to the cross of Christ, counted you as
righteous and blameless in Christ, and gave you his Holy Spirit to take up
residence inside of you, changing you from the inside out and guaranteeing a
future inheritance of breathtaking glory and joy.</p><p>He threw open the doors of heaven and invited
you into his throne room, into his presence, to approach him in bold prayer,
confident in his grace given to you in Jesus. He adopted you as his child- a
son or daughter of the King of Kings!- and made you the recipient of all of his
promises to strengthen you and guide you and forgive you and protect you and
bless you and change you and use you. Oh Christian, know what happened to you
because of the gospel which you received! </p><p>We can, and should,
continue unpacking this glorious gospel which you received. Make it one of your
central life ambitions to better know and love the gospel which you
received.</p><p>After all, the central theme
of heaven's will be "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain!" Learning to
love the gospel here will be a great rehearsal for loving the gospel there. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE GOSPEL IN WHICH YOU STAND</b></p><p>But don't stop with just
learning to appreciate the gospel which you received, because Paul didn't stop
there.</p><p>He continued: the gospel is not
just what you received at the outset of your Christian life; it is the gospel
"in which you stand."</p><p>That means that every day
of the Christian life is a day in which we must stand in the good of the
gospel. Standing in the gospel means daily- hourly, even- appropriating the
good of the gospel, the promises of the gospel, the comforts of the gospel, and
applying them to every need which arises.</p><p>When you stumble into sin, standing in the gospel means coming with
brokenness and boldness to the throne of grace to find assurance once again
that the blood of Jesus does indeed cleanse us from every sin (1 John 1:7).
When you are anxious, standing in the gospel means reminding yourself that,
"If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son
but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all
things?" (Romans 8:31-32). When you are tired of warring against your sin,
standing in the gospel means "fixing your eyes on Jesus, the author and
perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross"
(Hebrews 12:2), and finding in him strength to continue running the race with
endurance. When you are struggling to forgive someone who has hurt you,
standing in the gospel means preaching Colossians 3:13 to your unruly heart:
"As the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive!"</p><p>Notice two things about
that paragraph. Firstly, what I just did was "cross connections"-
drawing a line from the gospel to a specific area in your life (in this case,
guilt, anxiety, weariness, and hurt). Secondly, I did that with Scripture. The
power of the gospel lies in applying specific Scripture to specific needs, not
just in general things like "Jesus loves me, this I know." That's
true, but the Holy Spirit has only promised to work through his Word, not in
generally true statements. This means that if we are to stand in the gospel,
we've got to know our Bibles. When you're angry at a remark that a co-worker
made, you don't have the time or wherewithal to go back to your desk and flip
through your Bible hoping to find something useful. Standing in the gospel
means equipping yourself with the sword of the Spirit- the Word of God- before
the battle. I think that's why Paul said, "stand in the gospel," not
just "stand on the gospel;" picture standing in a swimming pool and
being completely immersed in it. Immerse yourself in God's Word with a
particular eye for the gospel and for cross connections, and use them as fuel
for your fight. I would encourage you to commit the cross connection verses in
this study to memory so that they are ready when you need them.</p><p>That's one of the primary ways God helps us
to stand in the good of the gospel.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE GOSPEL BY WHICH YOU ARE BEING SAVED</b></p><p>But there is also a third
category of how we relate to the gospel. The gospel isn't just what we
received; it's not even just what we stand in. The gospel is also the means by
which we are "being saved."</p><p>That present tense verb
might be puzzling to you.</p><p>We tend to
think of "getting saved" as a one-time past event, as in, "I was
saved when I was ten at summer camp." And while that's true, that's only
part of how the Bible talks about salvation.</p><p>The Bible also talks about progressive and future salvation- that moment
by moment we are being saved from sin and will ultimately be saved from the final
judgment.</p><p>Past, present, and future
salvation are connected, obviously; you can't have one without the other two.
But biblically, they are distinct, and it's helpful to see the distinction.</p><p>Here, Paul has already
highlighted how the gospel saved us (past tense)- it was the gospel that we received.
And he's shown us how the gospel is currently saving us from sin (present
tense)- it is the gospel in which we stand.</p><p>But the gospel also has a future tense role- it is the gospel that will
keep us believing, keep us holding to Christ and him holding onto us, and will
usher us through the fires of final judgment into everlasting joy and peace.</p><p>The gospel does this in
two ways: one, by making promises to you, and two, by keeping us believing
them. 1 Corinthians 15:2 continues, "the gospel...by which you are being
saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you-- otherwise you have
believed in vain." The gospel promises to save all who hold fast in faith
until the end, and that it is only those who hold fast to the end that are
truly saved (see Hebrews 3:14). The gospel promises, "Neither death nor
life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to
separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."</p><p>And then the gospel delivers on that promise,
by God holding you through every stumble of sin and backsliding of unbelief,
through every trial and storm, through everything present and yet to come,
keeping you coming back to the cross, keeping you persevering in faith, keeping
you dependent on grace, until the day you cross the finish line into glory.</p><p>This is really important
to know and believe, because I believe that being confident in your future
security is crucial to obeying God in the present. He promises to take care of
us in the future, so we trust him and obey him and sacrifice for his kingdom in
the present.</p><p>But what if he doesn't take
care of you in the future? What if he lets you slip through his fingers, and
you shipwreck your faith and sin so badly that he kicks you out of his family? </p><p>If you think that couldn't
happen to you, you're naive. Do you think your willpower is strong enough to
make sure you never turn away from Jesus? What assurance do you have that
you'll wake up tomorrow morning still believing in Jesus? If your confidence is
in your own ability to keep believing, I've got news for you: your heart is way
more fickle than you think it is. Or do you think salvation is some sort of
one-and-done fire insurance policy that makes your ongoing trust in Jesus
irrelevant? My confidence that I will be a believer tomorrow, and the day after
that, and the day after that, all the way to heaven, is not rooted in my
ability to persevere in faith; it's rooted in God's ability to persevere in
faithfulness to his promises, to never turn away from doing me good, and to
keep me believing and coming back to him in repentance and trust day after day
after day.</p><p>The gospel is that by
which we are being saved. In the gospel, God promises to make you his child,
and never disown you. He promises to give you faith to believe, and keep you
believing all the way until glory. The gospel is not just the news of past
grace; it is the promise of future grace. Knowing this will be the heart of
several of the cross connections we'll look at together, and will be a common
thread running through all of them: God's promises of future grace, bought by
the blood of Jesus, are what sustain obedience and sacrifice.</p><p>These three categories of
how the gospel functions in our lives- the gospel we receive, in which we
stand, and by which we are being saved- are the connections from the cross to
our lives. The cross wasn't just an event two thousand years ago-- it is news
to be received, grace to be applied, and promises to be believed.</p><picture>
