**_Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved,
compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience ~Colossians 3:12_**

Patience is one of those
fruits of the Spirit that most of wish we had more of, but aren't eager to be
in situations where we actually need it. We often pray, "Lord, give me
patience," hoping that he'll somehow zap us with a patience gun, not
realizing that the way he answers that prayer is by putting us in situations
where we are forced to grow in patience. Like a muscle, patience grows and
strengthens as it is used. Noisy kids, irritating classmates, frustrating
family members, pesky neighbors, uptight church people, slow drivers, cable
company customer service... these are God's means of grace in our lives to grow
the precious, Christ-like fruit of patience.

And yet, how does that
growth actually happen? What's the difference between blowing your temper at
your kids after a long day, and being able to treat them with grace under the
same circumstances? You know that sometimes those difficult circumstances push
you to exercise patience, and other times just push you to the end of your
rope. Those difficult people in your life that God wants to use as means of
grace could quite easily just be means of grumpiness. Circumstances by
themselves aren't enough to change our hearts; God doesn't use those
circumstances only. The most effective way to grow the fruit of patience in
your heart is by the Holy Spirit connecting the gospel of God's patience
towards you to those circumstances in your life that require you to exercise
patience towards others.

THE CHIEF OF SINNERS

The apostle Paul knew a
thing or two about God's patience, and was continually and increasingly amazed
at the undeserved, gracious, patient way that God treated him. His story is
well known: before his dramatic encounter with the risen Jesus, he was your
typical Middle Eastern terrorist on his way to firebomb some churches and round
up and execute Christians. He was a zealot, a fundamentalist extremis--
basically a first-century Jewish version of Osama bin Laden. Acts 9 begins the
story of his conversion with this description of Paul (then Saul): "Saul,
still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord..."
Breathing threats and murder: this guy's whole life and existence was bent on
blood and killing. It's helpful to see his anti-Christian activities in this
harsh light of truth, because it highlights the incredible transformation that
took place in his life. The terrorist, the murderer, transformed by grace and
made not just a believer but a missionary, an apostle, and the human author of
nearly half the New Testament. For the rest of his life he stood as a monument
to mercy, to the breathtaking truth that no one is beyond the reach of
sovereign, saving grace.

Paul never got over what
God did to him and for him. He never got used to grace. In fact, as the years
passed, his amazement only increased. You can actually see this progression
from his earliest letters to his later ones, as his self-understanding of grace
deepened. From 1 Corinthians, one of his earliest letters, to Ephesians, to 1
Timothy (one of his later letters), see how his self-description changes:

__

_For I am _

_**the least of the apostles**_

, unworthy to be called an apostle,
because I persecuted the church of God. ~1 Corinthians 15:9

__

_To me, though I am _

___**the very least of all the saints**_

, this
grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.
~Ephesians 3:8

__

_The saying is trustworthy and
deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save _

___**sinners, of whom I am the foremost.**_

~1 Timothy 1:15

Early in his Christian
life, amazed by God's grace, he freely confessed that he was the least of all
the apostles. "If you line up all the leaders, I should be at the back!"
he would have said; "I don't deserve to preach about Jesus." Fast
forward a couple years, and you hear how his self-assessment has declined:
"I'm not just the least of the leaders; I'm the least of all the saints!
I'm the worst person in the church." Finally, as an old man, he's gone
even lower: "I'm the foremost, the chief of all the sinners. I'm the worst
person I know."

Does that sound depressing
to you? Or do you see it as the key to joy, humility, and patience? This is the
mark of all true holiness. Growth in godliness is always accompanied by a
growing sense of your own sin. If you think you're growing as a Christian but
don't see your sin more clearly, you're deceiving yourself. But this isn't bad
news, because true godliness grows at the foot of the cross, where all your sin
was paid for and covered. New awareness of indwelling sin should lead to newer appreciation
of grace, and new appreciation of grace should lead to fresh grieving for the
sin that still remains. This is the "vicious cycle" of
gospel-centered self-awareness in which all the fruits of the Spirit,
especially patience, thrive.

Paul's last statement,
from 1 Timothy, is particularly instructive for us in our study of patience.
Here's the entirety of what he said to the young pastor Timothy:

__

_"Formerly I was a blasphemer,
persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted
ignorantly in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the
faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. The saying is trustworthy and
deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But I received mercy for this reason, that
in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an
example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life."_

Paul connects the
extravagant, astonishing mercy he received to us; the reason, he said, that God
showed him mercy is so that his life would display Jesus' "perfect
patience" as an example to every other sinner who worried that God's grace
wouldn't go deep enough to rescue them. Paul says, "If Jesus could save
me, then you've got nothing to worry about."

I believe that the best
way to grow in patience toward others is to live in daily increasing amazement
at the perfect patience of Jesus towards me. Like the rest of the fruits of the
Spirit, patience is a flower that grows best in the blood-soaked soil of
Calvary, cultivated from brokenhearted, humbled meditation on Jesus' sacrifice
there. 

WEARING JESUS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME

That brings us to
Colossians 3:12-13, our Cross Connection verse for patience. In this text, Paul
calls believers to put on Jesus' own attitude as "clothing," if you
will, for their heart.

__

_Put on, then, as God's chosen ones, holy
and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience,
bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving
each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive._

You can see that this text
is much more than a Cross Connection about patience; it encompasses compassion,
kindness, humility, meekness, and mercy as well. This is a treasure trove of
practical gospel living, so we will be returning to this verse several times in
our study of other virtues. What I do want us to see now is how each of these
virtues that we are commanded to "put on" are virtues that Jesus
himself displays on our behalf in the gospel. The context of Colossians 3 makes
it clear that the command to put on compassion, kindness, humility, meekness,
patience, and mercy is nothing more than a command to put on Christ himself.
"Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to
gratify its desires" (Romans 13:14). So let's look briefly at each of
these virtues, so that before we try to "wear" them ourselves, we
first see them exhibited in Jesus.

****

**COMPASSION**

Three times each in
Matthew, Mark, and Luke we are told that Jesus had compassion. "When he
saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and
helpless, like sheep without a shepherd" (Matthew 9:36)-- so he taught
them truth and told his disciples to ask God to send more laborers into the
harvest. "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me
now three days and have nothing to eat" (Mark 8:2)-- so he multiplied
bread and fed the entire multitude. "When the Lord saw her, he had
compassion on her and said to her, 'Do not weep,'" (Luke 7:13)-- so he
raised the widow's son from the dead. Those three examples give us a clear
working definition of compassion: empathy translated into action.

Stop and consider for a
moment: Jesus had empathy with all the people he encountered. I find that
remarkable-- the Sovereign, Eternal One, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords,
sympathized with and pitied suffering whenever he saw it. Our God is not high
and exalted and transcendent only (although he certainly is those things!); no,
he is also lowly, empathetic, and compassionate. Jesus empathizes with us,
feels our pain, and in fact has made our pain his own, so that he would forever
not just be a conquering Savior, but a compassionate Savior. "Surely he
has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows" (Isaiah 53:4). He was fully
human, a man of sorrows, familiar with suffering, so that he could be an
empathetic King. "He had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so
that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God,
to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For because he himself has suffered
when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted" (Hebrews
2:17-18).

You can see in those two
texts, Isaiah 53 and Hebrews 2, how Jesus' compassion is not just shown in his
healing and feeding and raising, but in his sacrifice for sin on the cross.
"He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows"-- to the cross. He
was "a merciful and faithful high priest"-- so that he could make
propitiation, become a wrath absorbing sacrifice, for our sins. It was Jesus'
compassion that drove him to the cross and qualified him to be our Savior.

Compassion is an essential
quality of kindness. Kindness is focused on the good of others; compassion
looks outside of your own circumstances and puts yourself in the shoes and
suffering of others, and looks for ways to ease their burden. Compassion, then,
is the practical heart of kindness-- which the next divine attribute that we
are told to put on.

****

**KINDNESS**

In Luke 6:35, Jesus tells
his disciples to love their enemies, and connects their motivation to the
gospel and the very heart of God:

__

_But love your enemies, and do good,
and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you
will be sons of the Most High, for (because!) he is kind to the ungrateful and
the evil._

Look and see what Jesus says about the heart
of God: "He is kind to the ungrateful and the evil." Incredible! Not,
"He is kind to those who respond with appropriate gratitude and
goodness." No-- he is kind to exactly the opposite people you'd expect;
the ones who don't respond with gratitude, the ones who rebel against him-- in
short, you and me. 

If you don't see your own
face in the words "ungrateful and evil," take a look at yourself in
the mirror of the Word and ponder your own life. To what extent is your life
marked by thankfulness and gratitude? Think of all the blessings God has given
you-- life and breath and friends and family and prosperity and forgiveness and
eternal life and fellowship with him, and the list goes on and on (and will
continue going on and on forever). Are you more aware of what you've been
given, or what you lack? Are you continually thankful for those things God has
given you? If not, you're ungrateful, like a spoiled kid at Christmas who, in
the midst of all his presents, throws a tantrum because he didn't get
everything he asked for. 

We need to see and feel
the depths of our ingratitude, so that the force of Jesus' words will hit us
with the wonder he intends: "The Most High is kind to the ungrateful and
evil-- to me!" Seeing ourselves as the unworthy recipients of the Most
High's kindness will break us into a posture of humility out of which we can
start being kind to others who don't deserve it either.

****

**HUMILITY**

Funny, isn't it, how this
meditation on the list of attributes in Colossians 3-- "compassion,
kindness, humility, meekness, patience"-- has so seamlessly flowed one
into another (it's almost like Paul intended it that way!). Compassion is the
practical heart of kindness; God's kindness brings us to humility.

In Philippians 2, Paul entreats
the Philippian believers to "do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but
in humility count others more significant" than themselves. He points them
to the example of Jesus in the gospel to shape and motivate their own humility:

__

_Have this mind among yourselves,
which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not
count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking
the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in
human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even
death on a cross._

We'll be tackling the
virtue of humility in a future Cross Connection as well, so we won't spend a
lot of time unpacking this rich text. Just a simple observation again: Jesus is
simultaneously the only person in the world to have ever displayed perfect,
absolute humility, and yet the only person in the world who has nothing to be
humble about. He is the exalted, glorious God-- the most worthy Person in the
entire universe. Unlike us, he has nothing intrinsic about himself to be humble
about. He has no defects, no failings, no lack, no inabilities, no sins, no
shortcomings. This is practically the definition of what it means to be God.

So consider the wonder,
then, that this perfect God modeled perfect humility for us. The One who is
worthy of all worship did not count equality with his Father a thing to be held
onto, but willingly surrendered it for us. The One who is all-powerful and
all-glorious emptied himself of all his divine prerogatives to rescue us. The
One who is worthy of all service assumed the body, role, and position of a
servant, feeding, healing, washing feet, and serving us all the way to the
cross. The One who is the Author and Sustainer of Life humbled himself all the
way to the fullest possible extent of humility: the helpless and horrible
indignity of a brutal, shameful, naked death on the cross. Oh the glory of
Jesus' perfect humility!

****

**MEEKNESS**

Meekness is what Jesus'
kind of humility looks like practically. Meekness is not weakness; rather,
meekness is strength under control. Jesus, the omnipotent and divine Son of
God, was not weak. He calmed storms, cast out demons, overturned tables,
rebuked religious leaders, and raised the dead. And yet, at the same time, he
was meek and gentle; he wept with mourners, pitied outcasts, touched lepers,
and cradled children. Both his emotions and his divine powers were fully
governed and controlled by his humility and love. In Matthew 11, he invited his
followers into the beautiful rest and salvation of his perfect meekness:

__

_Come to me, all who labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from
me, for I am gentle and meek in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For
my yoke is easy, and my burden is light._

This invitation into the
character of Christ is an invitation into the blood-bought, cross-wrought
gospel. The invitation is given to those who labor under the impossibilities of
God's holy law, and to those who are heavy laden under the burden of sin and
guilt. Jesus' humility and meekness took him to the cross to fulfill the law
and forgive guilt, so that with perfect gentleness and tenderness he could say
to every struggling sinner, "Let me exchange burdens with you; I will take
your sin, and the only burden I place on you is the command to rest in
me."

****

**PATIENCE**

Our survey of Jesus'
attributes in Colossians 3 now brings us to patience, which is the main focus
of this Cross Connection chapter. Here's the whole text again:

__

_Put on, then, as God's chosen ones,
holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and
patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another,
forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive._

We've seen how each of
Jesus' attributes here builds on the one before it into a crescendo of glory,
arriving at the pinnacle of Paul's command here: "patience, bearing with
one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other;
as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive." Patience,
forbearance, and forgiveness are really different dimensions of the same
thing-- the shining forth of God's heart in Jesus. When Moses asked for a
face-to-face encounter with the glory of God, here's what he got: "The
LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in
steadfast love and faithfulness" (Exodus 34:6).

This is, literally, the heart of who God is:
merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love. His
"perfect patience" towards the apostle Paul is also the same way he
treats stumbling, bumbling, sinful me.

The command to be patient,
then, is the command to wear the heart of God on your sleeve, to put on Jesus' perfect
patience towards you, to bear with (literally, "to put up with")
others like God has patiently and graciously borne with you, to extend the same
forgiveness to others that has been lavished on you. Patience is nothing more
or less than acting towards others like Jesus has acted towards me. The reason
that the last several pages have focused on all of Jesus attitudes towards me
is because extended meditation on those attributes is the best way to start
growing them in your own life.

Think of those in your
life who treat you with ingratitude, hostility, or disregard. In other words,
who treats you like you treat God? The great question that Jesus' patience puts
before us is: will you treat them like God has treated you?

__

__

_Lord Jesus, Your patience towards a slow-to-learn,
slower-to-obey sinner like me is astounding. Thank you for treating me, not as
I deserve, but in accordance with your own great heart of compassion, patience,
and kindness. Help me, by the Holy Spirit's enabling, to more clearly see your
heart towards me, and to wear that as my own heart towards others, so that they
would see more of you and less of me._
