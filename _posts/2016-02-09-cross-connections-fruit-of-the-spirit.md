_**He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. ~John 16:14**_

For the last nine lessons,
we've been unpacking the fruit of the Spirit and seeing how each one connects
to the cross. We really could have done this with any virtue of the Christian
life (and, in the next nine chapters, we will). Every single thing that the
Bible tells Christians to do, think, believe, or say is somewhere explicitly
tied to the cross. The broad scope of this book-- nine fruits of the Spirit,
nine other virtues-- is meant to demonstrate that.

But spending 150 pages
meditating on how the cross motivates love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control raises an interesting
question. If those nine virtues are fruits of the Holy Spirit-- that is, traits
that the Holy Spirit develops in believers-- and are also meant to be motivated
by the cross,

The way the Holy Spirit
brings about transformation is by directing our attention to the cross of
Christ. what's the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the cross?

We could devote a whole
chapter, even a whole book, to this question. But it's not my purpose here to
lay out a thorough theology of the Holy Spirit. I just want you to realize one
simple thing: the way the Holy Spirit brings about transformation is by
directing our attention to the cross of Christ.

in John 16, Jesus tells
his disciples what the Holy Spirit will do after Jesus' crucifixion and
resurrection, when he is poured out on all those bought by the blood of Jesus:

__

_He will glorify me, for he will take
what is mine and declare it to you. ~John 16:14_

The Holy Spirit's role is
to glorify Jesus by taking everything about Jesus and declaring it to us. He
takes Jesus' love and declares it to us; he takes Jesus' glory and declares it
to us; he takes Jesus' meekness and majesty and grace and power and holiness
and humility and declares it to us. The Spirit doesn't like the spotlight; what
he loves is directing our attention and affection away from ourselves and onto
Jesus. So in all these fruits of the Spirit we have studied, and in every other
Spirit-wrought virtue in the Christian life, the way we grow is not by focusing
on that virtue, or even by focusing on the Holy Spirit. No, the Spirit helps us
do what he loves to do: fix our eyes on Christ and him crucified.

As the Holy Spirit directs
the gaze of our hearts to Jesus, this is where transformation happens. That's
why, in many respects, all these Cross Connections chapters are nothing more
than extended meditations on what Jesus has done for us. That's exactly the
point. Ponder these words from an old Puritan prayer, taken from the book The
Valley of Vision,

and make them your
own:

O God the Holy Spirit, 

Take the things of Christ
and show them to my soul; 

through thee may I daily
learn more of his love, grace,

compassion, faithfulness,
beauty;

Lead me to the cross and
show me his wounds,

the hateful nature of
evil, the power of Satan;

May I there see my sins as

the nails that transfixed him,

the cords that bound him,

the thorns that tore him,

the sword that pierced him.

Help me to find in his
death the reality and immensity of his love.

Open for me wondrous
volumes of truth in his, 'It is finished.'

Increase my faith in the
clear knowledge of

atonement achieved, expiation completed,

satisfaction made, guilt done away,

my debt paid, my sins forgiven,

my person redeemed, my soul saved,

hell vanquished, heaven opened,

eternity made mine.

O Holy Spirit, deepen in
me these saving lessons.

Write them upon my heart,
that my walk be

sin-loathing, sin-fleeing,
Christ-loving.

This is how the Holy
Spirit does his work in our hearts: by taking the cross of Christ and showing
to our souls the reality and immensity of his love, until our lives overflow
with transforming thankfulness. One of the ways he does that in his Word is by
drawing connections, lines of motivation, from the great work that Christ did
to the work he is doing in our hearts. Live your lives in these lines of
motivation, and pray that the Holy Spirit will continue to direct you to the
cross.

That's why so many of our
Cross Connections focused so much on Jesus and what he did. Sometimes it may
have felt to you like the practical application was almost an afterthought; it
was ten pages of Jesus and then one page of "What about me?" Again,
that's exactly the point. Transformation comes as we behold Jesus' glory in the
gospel. "We all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are
being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For
this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit" (2 Corinthians 3:18). That's
how the Spirit transforms us: by fixing our eyes on Jesus.

As we conclude these nine
lessons on the fruit of the Spirit and turn to nine other Spirit-wrought
virtues and disciplines, let these words from a modern-day hymn by David Ward,
adapted from that Puritan prayer, become your prayer:

O God the Holy Spirit,

Direct me to the cross

Where I can see the
suffering

My waywardness has cost.

In Jesus' death please
show me

The power of my sin

And by his life convince
me

This battle he will win.

O God the Holy Spirit,

Put Jesus on display;

Remind me how my Savior

Took all my guilt away.

My sins were all forgiven

And satisfaction made.

Atonement was completed;

My captive soul was saved.

O God the Holy Spirit,

Come deepen and impart

These saving, loving
lessons

Upon my desperate heart,

That I might loathe my
evil

And flee from Satan's
snares,

Then run to my Redeemer

And cast on him my cares.

May God the Holy Spirit
direct you to the cross and put Jesus on display as he imparts these saving,
loving lessons to your heart.
