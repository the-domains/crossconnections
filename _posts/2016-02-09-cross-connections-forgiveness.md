**_Bear with one another and, if one has a complaint against
another, forgive each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must
forgive. ~Colossians 3:13_**

Of all the Cross
Connections in Scripture, the connection between the cross and forgiveness is
probably the most obvious-- and the most profound. We've already seen a dozen
different iterations and nuances of the command to forgive others; this is a
critical component of many other Cross Connections. Love gives itself away,
even to enemies, which necessarily involves turning the other cheek and
extending mercy. The fruit of kindness draws on God's kindness to us in order
to fund costly, unrequited kindness to those who do not respond in kindness to
us. Patience is a continual act of forgiveness, even drawing from the same text
as our forgiveness Cross Connection. 

So in this chapter, rather
than rehashing those lessons again (although that might not be a bad idea,
since we need to relearn those lessons every day), we will look at forgiveness
from a slightly different angle.

To see
more clearly what forgiveness should look like in our lives, and how it
connects back to the cross, we will unpack one parable Jesus told in Matthew
18\.

HOW MANY TIMES?

In Matthew 18, beginning
in verse 21, Jesus has just given his disciples instructions on how to be
reconciled with a brother or sister who sins against you. Peter (good ol'
reckless, big-mouthed, big-hearted, bone-headed Peter), however, wanted some
clarification. Perhaps Jesus' instructions seemed a bit extreme and he was
thinking, "Gosh, if I need to pursue reconciliation with this much
perseverance, my whole life will be about pursuing reconciliation!"
(Which, of course, was exactly Jesus' point.) So, looking for a loophole, or
perhaps some reasonable moderating of Jesus' command, he asked, "Lord, how
often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven
times?"

I imagine that, as Peter
said this, his chest puffed up a little and he looked around at the other
disciples with some condescension (this, of course, would not be totally unlike
Peter). You see, in Judaism, forgiving somebody three times was sufficient to
show a forgiving spirit. After three times, bitterness or revenge was an
acceptable response. So Peter, in volunteering to forgive up to seven times,
probably thought he was being generous and super-spiritual. He probably
expected to receive a commendation from Jesus, and for Jesus to say something
like, "Heavens, no, Peter! Five times ought to do it." Instead,
Jesus' answer probably made his jaw drop.

Jesus said to him, "I
do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times." Now, Jesus didn't
mean, "Your number is too low, Peter. Keep count up until seventy-seven
times, and then cut that jerk loose." That's not what Jesus meant by
saying "seventy-seven times." Rather, Jesus is turning Peter's
question on its head by playing a word game with the number seven. In the
Bible, seven is a number signifying completion or fullness. Putting two sevens
together intensifies it, making it not just complete but endlessly complete. So
for Jesus to tell Peter to forgive seventy-seven times simply means, "Keep
forgiving fully and completely, over and over and over again." In other
words, "It's not about a number, Peter. It's not about keeping score. It's
about never-ending mercy." 

IMPOSSIBLE DEBT, IMPOSSIBLE MERCY

And then, to illustrate
and extend his point farther than Peter had ever dreamed, Jesus told an
incredible parable. It's not as well-known as some of his other stories like
the prodigal son or the sower and the seeds, but I think this is the most
significant teaching Jesus ever gave on the nature of sin and mercy and the
gospel. This parable overflows with deeply profound significance for our lives,
both as we ponder how we should treat others, and as we contemplate how God has
treated us.

__

_Therefore the kingdom of heaven may
be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. When he
began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. And
since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and
children and all that he had, and payment to be made. So the servant fell on
his knees, imploring him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you
everything.' And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him
and forgave him the debt._

Let's pause and consider
the full impact of what he is saying. First, as will become clear later in the
parable, the king in the story symbolizes God, and the debtor symbolizes you.
So, then, this is much more than a story of a king and a servant; it is a
picture of our debt before God, the holy King of the universe.

THE TEN THOUSAND TALENT
DEBTOR IS YOU

"The kingdom of
heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his
servants. When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten
thousand talents." In light of Jesus' intended meaning and the identity of
these characters, this realization should sober you: this is a true story, and
it's about you. The ten thousand talent debtor is you. And there really is a
King, who really will, one day, settle every account and debt in the universe.
And one day (perhaps sooner than later), you will be summoned to stand before
this King. Your debt, recorded in heaven, will be read, and payment will be
required.

So what is this debt that
we owe? Colossians 2:14 describes it as "the record of debt that stood
against us with its legal demands." This is the debt of sin that we owe to
God. Every act of rebellion, from a lustful glance to an arrogant thought, to
hatred and murder, demands payment in the courtroom of heaven. And every moment
of our lives-- each one being a moment of forbearance, in which we are not
required to pay what we owe-- our debt is mounting up in the record books of
heaven. Ezra 9:6 vividly describes this debt: "Our iniquities have risen
higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens."
Moment by moment, day by day, the debt of unpunished sin that we owe to God
continues to spiral upwards. And one day the bank of heaven will call our loan,
and we will stand before the King, and he will say, "It is time to pay
what you owe." 

This looming reality
should make us tremble. If you have ever been in a situation where you were
drowning in debt, you know how it overshadows everything else. When you owe
$20,000 in credit card bills and have no way to pay the minimum payment, let
alone the entire debt, the anxiety and weight can be crushing. How strange it
is, then, that we continue to blithely rack up higher and higher bills with the
bank of heaven, never stopping to consider that one day, that bill will come due.
We obviously don't have the proper respect and fear of this King (which, of
course, is the root cause of all this debt to begin with).

****

**IMPOSSIBLE DEBT**

In this story, we see a
picture of ourselves standing before the King with an incalculable debt. Jesus
said that this particular servant owed the king "ten thousand
talents." Now just to be clear, these are not talents like juggling or
singing on key. In the first century, a talent was a monetary unit worth about
twenty years' wages for a typical laborer. Of course, no one carried around
talents in their wallet (in Old Testament times, it equalled 75 pounds of
gold!), but it was a convenient measure when talking about vast sums of money.
For a servant to owe ten thousand talents would have been absolutely absurd.
Think about it: one talent was worth twenty years' wages. That means that ten
thousand talents is 200,000 years of wages! This is an absurdly,
astronomically, impossibly incalculable debt. To put it into modern terms, if a
typical worker earns $50,000 a year, a talent would be about a million
dollars... and ten thousand talents would be ten billion dollars. This servant
owed the king billions of dollars, an amount that would literally take
thousands of lifetimes to repay.

Jesus gave this absurd number
so that the story would be shocking. Because, remember: this is a true story,
and the servant in the story is you. You don't just stand before God with a
debt of sin that you can negotiate or earn your way out of; you stand before
God with an impossible debt that would take a thousand lifetimes to begin
paying. 

In the story, the king
pronounces a just punishment: "Since he could not pay, his master ordered
him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to
be made." This servant's profligacy had not only ruined him, but had
ruined all the lives around him. But even a lifetime of slavery could not begin
to pay a thousand lifetimes' worth of debt.

Throughout the Bible, we
are given horrifying glimpses of the reality to which this parable points. All
those who stand before God with an impossible, infinite unpaid debt will find
out that their profligacy has cost them dearly; a few decades of spiritually
spendthrift ways will leave them holding a bill that will take eternity to pay.
This is the horrifying and just reason that hell exists: in the end, every
account will be settled. "The smoke of their torment goes up forever and
ever, and they have no rest, day or night" (Revelation 14:11). "If
anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the
lake of fire" (Revelation 20:15).

We are lingering on this
awful reality because it is absolutely essential that we come to grips with
this truth: you and I are the ten thousand talent debtor, and the punishment
described in Revelation 14 and 20 is exactly what you and I deserve. We must
know this, and we must feel the holy fear of debt, if the rest of the parable
will have its intended effect on us.

****

**TWO WAYS TO PAY**

As we keep reading in the
parable, it turns out that there are two ways that this debt can be paid, and
the tragedy is that most people choose the first way.

__

_And since he could not pay, his
master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had,
and payment to be made. So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, 'Have
patience with me, and I will pay you everything.' And out of pity for him, the
master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt._

The first way is that you
can pay the debt yourself. If you think that sounds like a fool's errand, you'd
be right. How in the world could you ever hope to pay back a thousand
lifetimes' worth of debt? 

And yet, that's exactly
what this foolish servant proposes. "Have patience with me, and I will pay
you everything." Oh really? You and what gold mine? The fact that this
servant thinks he can pay means he is totally delusional, whether about the
actual amount he owes or his own ability to pay.

And yet, isn't that how so
many people approach God? "As long as my good deeds outweigh my bad deeds,
God will let me into heaven," is basically exactly what this man is
proposing: I will earn my way out of this hole and back into your good graces.
This parable is in the Bible in order to pull that delusional rug out from under
us and bring us to our knees. If it is up to us to pay our debt, the only way
we will pay is in hell. If you think that your debt against God is something
you can pay for by your own good deeds or religious behavior, I've got news for
you: you will pay for your debt, and you will pay it in hell. If we are to have
any hope of being free of our debt, there must be another way for it to be
paid.

And the good news of this
parable, and of the gospel, is: there is another way for the debt to be paid.
Trying to pay it yourself will result in a one-way ticket to hell. But there is
somebody who can pay it: the king himself. In response to this servant's
reckless spending and delusional arrogance, the king's response is baffling:
mercy. "And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him
and forgave the debt."

****

**IMPOSSIBLE MERCY**

With a word, out a heart
overflowing with pity and compassion, the king simply releases the man from his
thousand lifetimes of debt. The crushing mountain of debt he could never, ever
repay, was gone in a moment. How would you respond if you were that servant?
Remember... you are that servant.

Think about what this act
of mercy cost the king. He just took a ten billion dollar write-down on his net
worth. Forgiving the servant's debt means, ultimately, that the king himself
paid it. His treasury was emptied, his kingdom was bankrupted, in order to
release this one foolish servant from his debt.

What a picture this is of
the King of heaven, and how he deals with foolish servants like us! We owe an
infinite debt from our lifetime of foolish, costly, reckless self-serving
rebellion. And the King and Judge, against whom we have sinned and to whom we
owe an infinite debt, responds by paying the debt for us. We deserve death and
hell, and so the King steps off his throne and takes the punishment for us. The
record of our debt, with its demands of death and imprisonment, was written
over to Jesus' account. "And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the
uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven
us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us
with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross." Look
to the cross and see your ten thousand talent debt nailed there and stamped
with the blood-bought seal, "Paid In Full."

What kind of love is this,
that pays the debts of foolish servants, out of the riches of his own
extravagant kindness? What kind of love lays down its life to pay a debt it did
not owe, so that I could inherit a kingdom and eternal riches I do not deserve?
This is love and mercy beyond all reckoning, beyond all fathoming. This is
impossible mercy. So how could our response to this mercy be any less than the
line of the hymn,

Love so amazing, so divine,

Demands my soul, my life, my all

A SHOCKING RESPONSE TO SHOCKING MERCY

That's why the servant's
response to this impossible mercy is so shocking. As the parable continues, you
don't see any thankfulness on the part of the servant. You don't see him
leaping and dancing and praising God and thanking the king. You don't see him
kneeling down in humble, thankful submission. You don't see him running out of
the gates of the palace to tell everyone how good this king is. In other words,
you don't see any evidence that the king's mercy has meant anything to him.
Rather, what you see is appalling.

__

_But when that same servant went out,
he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing
him, he began to choke him, saying, "Pay what you owe." So his fellow
servant fell down and pleaded with him, saying, "Have patience with me,
and I will pay you." He refused and went and put him in prison until he
should pay the debt. When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they
were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that
had taken place. Then his master summoned him and said to him, "You wicked
servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. And should
not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?"_

The moment that the
servant, newly freed from his ten billion dollar debt, leaves the palace, he
sees another person-- a "fellow servant"-- who happens to owe him a
hundred denarii. Now, a denarius was a coin worth one day's wage. A hundred
denarii, then, is about twenty weeks' wages-- not chump change. In modern
terms, we're talking about $20,000 or so. That's a lot of money for one servant
to owe another servant. It's not unreasonable to ask to be paid back.

This one detail is just
another reason I love this parable. I love Jesus' tender realism here.
Remember, the debt in this story symbolizes the sin you've committed against
another person. This fellow servant owes $20,000\. That is not a small sum. In
sin terms, that means he has grievously hurt, wounded, or betrayed this other
servant. He is in great debt.

You see, it hurts to be
sinned against. Betrayal wounds. Friendships can be destroyed through
foolishness, and through willful attack. There are people in your life who have
deeply hurt you-- perhaps even done unspeakably wrong things to you. To use the
imagery of this parable, they owe you a great debt-- a debt of thousands and
thousands of dollars. To forgive the person who has wronged you would cost you
dearly. You might even feel that its unreasonable to be asked to forgive that
person. "If you had any idea what they did to me..." you say. And you
know what? You're right. That probably is asking too much. You could withhold
forgiveness and be completely fair. They don't deserve mercy. 

Under just about any circumstance,
it would be unreasonable to expect that servant to forgive his fellow servant
of the $20,000 debt... unless he had just been forgiven billions. And remember:
you are that servant.

This is the brilliance of
this parable. Jesus turns the tables on us and on all who hold grudges-- even
well-deserved ones-- and calls us to re-evaluate the hurts that others have
inflicted on us in light of the massive debt that we have accumulated against
God. "That guy owes you thousands and thousands of dollars worth of
punishment because of the way he treated you. That is true," Jesus says to
us. "But this is also true: you owe God billions and billions of dollars,
a thousand lifetimes of punishment, because of the way you have treated him.
And God, at great cost to himself, has paid your debt in full." Whatever
this person owes you, whatever they have done to you, pales in comparison with
the great debt you have accumulated with God.

THE NECESSITY OF MERCY

No matter how greatly
someone has sinned against you, it pales in comparison with your own debt
against God. And if God has forgiven you-- if his impossible, extravagant mercy
has reached your heart and paid your debt-- then your life will be changed, and
you will respond to people differently. "Should not you have had mercy on
your fellow servant, as I had on you?" the king asked the servant. That's
not just a helpful suggestion; it's an imperative, and an absolutely necessary
reality that needs to be evident in your life if you claim that the king has forgiven
your debt. Our Cross Connection verse says it just as firmly: "as the Lord
has forgiven you, so you also must forgive." There is no option for a
servant, who has been forgiven billions of dollars and thousands of lifetimes
of debt, to not respond with mercy toward the comparatively petty debts that
others incur with him.

Jesus concludes the
parable with this application, sobering in its finality.

__

_And in anger the master delivered him
to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. So also my heavenly Father
will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your
heart._

What provoked the king to
anger? Surprisingly, it wasn't the servant's great debt. It wasn't how he had
squandered the king's riches and was unable to repay. It wasn't how he
foolishly offered to pay the debt himself. No, what provoked the king to fury
was that the servant treated his fellow servant so differently than how he
himself had been treated by the king.

Why? What did that even
have to do with the king? And why would that provoke such a response from the
him? Because it showed that the servant utterly scorned the king's mercy. It
revealed how little he prized the treatment he had received, how little he
valued the king's costly forgiveness, and how lightly he viewed his own debt.
His lack of mercy exposed his lack of thankfulness and gratitude. It showed
that he viewed the king's extravagant benevolence as something to be abused and
taken for granted, not something to be cherished and imitated. And this made a
mockery of the king's mercy. Therefore the king's wrath was swift and fair:
"in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all
his debt."

Jesus' commentary on this
is devastating: "So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you,
if you do not forgive your brother from your heart." Jesus threatens hell
and punishment to all who do not gladly and willingly forgive. This is
chilling, sobering, frightening-- especially for all of us who struggle with a
bitter and unforgiving spirit. What does Jesus mean, and what does it mean for
us?

****

**THE PROOF OF PRIZING MERCY IS IN PASSING IT ON**

First, we should clarify
what Jesus doesn't mean. He doesn't mean that the way to earn God's forgiveness
is to forgive others. That would contradict the whole point of the parable,
which is that the king's lavish mercy is free and undeserved. The servant tried
to negotiate a payment plan with the king, not realizing the folly of what he
was doing.Your forgiving spirit will not qualify as a payment plan, any more
than any other good deed you could do. Remember it wasn't the servant's
forgiving spirit that qualified him for mercy. Rather, it was his unforgiving
spirit that disqualified him from receiving it.

That's a crucial
difference to see, if we are to uphold and love the gospel's message of free
grace, and if the gospel is to function properly in our lives. The moment you
turn the parable around and say that you have to forgive others in order to be
forgiven, you're now making the same foolish offer that the servant made:
"I'll pay you back, God, with my good behavior!" 

The point of what Jesus is
saying is this: the proof that you really prize God's mercy is that you gladly
and willingly pass it on to others. A forgiving spirit is proof that God's
mercy is precious to you, that you tremble at what your sin cost and the great
payment God made, that you are free from all your debt and full of thankfulness
and gratitude. An unforgiving spirit is proof that, at the very best, you have
a tragically shallow view of how God has treated you, and, at worst, that you
are no different from the unforgiving servant who scorned the king's kindness.

Those whom God has
released from their ten thousand talent debt, by nailing it to His Son's cross,
who see how grievous their own sin is and what God's mercy toward them cost
him, will prize that mercy. God's grace towards them will be precious to their
hearts. And Jesus says that the single best way to know whether or not God's
grace is precious to you is whether or not you extend grace to others. 

Look back to the icon at
the beginning of this chapter. That right angle is a picture of how God intends
his mercy to function in our lives. Vertical mercy from God to you is meant to
be bent outward at a ninety degree angle into horizontal mercy from you to
others. A heart that has been struck by the extravagant cost of God's mercy
will start to function like that right angle, receiving mercy from God and
extending it out to others. 

Will we do this perfectly?
No, of course not; that's why we need mercy in the first place. But oh, how
this parable should spur us on to intentional forgiveness. Both the great cost
paid by the king, and his fury at seeing his costly kindness treated so
lightly, should lend a weight and urgency and honesty to our own acts of
forgiveness. We who have been treated so unexpectedly by God should be marked
by unexpected mercy ourselves.

BEING THE TEN THOUSAND TALENT DEBTOR

So how can we become the
kind of people Jesus calls us to be in this parable-- people marked by
unexpected and unending mercy towards others? I think the key starts in seeing
ourselves in this story. In order for God's forgiveness to function in our
lives how he intends, we must start seeing ourselves as that ten thousand
talent debtor. So in closing, let's get practical in applying this lesson to
ourselves.

If you are struggling to
forgive someone, the ultimate issue is not what they did to you, or how bad it
was.

The ultimate issue is how you see
God's mercy to you, and your sin against God, in relation to that sin against
you. The secret is not counting up that hundred denarii that the other person
owes you, but seeing that hundred denarii in clear comparison with your ten
thousand talent (which, by the way, equals about 60,000,000 denarii) debt
against God.

So if you are struggling
to forgive somebody, your problem probably lies in one of two places (or
perhaps both):

****

**1) you view your sin too lightly- which means you
view God too lightly**

This doesn't mean that you
should be evaluating, "What's worse, their pride or my pride?" It's
not about tallying up who is a worse person. But if their arrogance towards you
feels like a bigger deal than your pride before a holy God, it means that you
have not rightly reckoned your guilt before God. You don't really believe that
you're a ten thousand debtor. When you are more concerned with what someone has
done against you than what you have done against God, that ultimately means
that you take yourself more seriously than you take God seriously. In other
words, you are acting like your own god.

The remedy to this is
two-fold: you need to deepen your understanding of your own sin, and you need
to deepen your understanding of God's holiness and greatness. The Old Testament
is a great place to learn this lesson. Camp out in the prophets, especially
Isaiah or Jeremiah, and read with an eye for God's glory and for vivid
descriptions of how offensive your sin is, and pray until the Holy Spirit
starts to work those realities into your heart.

Another way to deal with
this, in the moment when you're struggling to forgive, is to take a step back
and consider the other person's sin against you in light of all the times you
have done that same thing to others and to God. If they just snapped angrily at
you, a biblical heart response would be to start by thinking, "Gosh, I
have snapped angrily at a lot of people-- at my co-worker yesterday, at my wife
last week-- and even worse, I've harbored anger and bitterness in my heart. And
worse than that, how often have I gotten frustrated at God's perfect timing or
angrily doubted his goodness to me? Thank you God, for dealing with me with
such mercy!" In training yourself to think this way, you are training
yourself to think like the ten thousand talent debtor.

****

**2) you view God's grace too lightly**

If your heart hates the
idea of "letting someone off the hook," for what they've done to you,
it may be an indication that you are not fully grasping just how far God went,
and what it cost him, to "let you off the hook." If you are not
living in daily amazement that your ten thousand talent debt has been forgiven,
then you will be much more likely to view that hundred denarii offense against
you as a big deal.

It is a daily battle for
our apathetic, arrogant hearts to be amazed by God's amazing grace. It takes
the daily discipline of fixing your eyes on the cross in Scripture, and
meditating and praying on what you see there until its reality starts to burn
in your heart. Find gospel passages that unpack how far Jesus has gone to save
you, what you've been saved from, and the great love of God that pursued a
sinner like you. Study them, meditate on them, commit them to memory, and
listen to sermons on them. Listen to gospel-centered, cross-exalting worship music
until it gets stuck in your head and starts to influence the way you think and
feel. And pray, pray, pray, that in all of these pursuits God would open the
eyes of your heart to see the cross as beautiful and compelling. Pray and
pursue until the Holy Spirit starts making these realities come alive to you.

It will take a lifetime
and an eternity to properly and fully grasp all that it means to be the ten
thousand talent debtor who stands forgiven before a holy God of love. The
invitation of salvation-- the invitation of this gracious king-- is, "Come
and know my mercy more, until it overflows from you to a world who needs to
know it too."

__

_Father, In the face of my countless sins and
incalculable debt, your love goes beyond reckoning and your mercy beyond
measure. As deep as my sin goes, your grace goes deeper still. Thank you, thank
you, for the cross, and for the costly mercy that redeemed this debtor and
adopted this unworthy servant to be your child. As I pursue a greater
appreciation of all you've done for me in Christ, open my eyes by your Spirit
and make me into a monument to mercy. Make me a conduit and reflection of the
forgiveness that you've given to me, so that people will see the reality of the
cross in the mercy I extend to them._
