**_Welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the
glory of God. ~Romans 15:7_**

Have you ever been the odd
person out in a group? Most of us know
what it feels like to be a stranger in a room full of friends, to be the third
wheel, or worse, to receive the cold shoulder when reaching out to someone.
It's a feeling of shame, of aloneness, of hurt, even when those around you have
no idea what they are unintentionally doing. 

That unintentionality is
at the heart of a lot of unwelcoming behavior; people usually aren't cold and
cruel on purpose (if you are, it's a symptom of a far deeper problem). We're
just wrapped up in our own lives and our own friends, to the neglect and
exclusion of others around us. Most unwelcoming behavior is a result of our
default outlook of self-centeredness. It takes great intentionality to break
the cycle.

Sadly, lazy, unwelcoming
selfishness infects the church and the people of God. Have you ever visited a
new church, only to have no one greet you except the usher at the door? Have
you ever visited a small group and found it impossible to enter into relationship
or conversation with anyone? Ever been the victim of a youth group clique? Have
you ever sat alone at a church function surrounded by happy, chatting friends?
Or turn it around on your own heart: do you seek out visitors to greet on
Sunday morning, or do you just hang around your friends or family? I wonder how
many visitors and seekers have been turned off to the claims of the gospel
simply because no one bothered to welcome them.

In Romans 15, Paul lays
out a radically different vision of what our churches and families and groups
of friends should look like. In this passage, Paul takes what seems like a
relatively trivial and simple issue-- welcoming others-- and imbues it with
profound significance by connecting it to missions, to God's glory, and to the
cross. Paul doesn't see our welcoming attitude as a light or insignificant
thing. Instead, he tells us that massive realities are at stake in whether or
not we will be welcoming people. The gospel is at stake in our welcoming. God's
glory is at stake in our welcoming. And God's mission to reach your
neighborhood and the nations is at stake in our welcoming. 

In this study, we will be
looking at four things: first, we'll examine the command to be welcoming and
consider the full implications of what that should look like. Then we'll see
how Paul connects this virtue, first to the cross, then to God's glory, and
finally to God's mission to make Jesus Christ famous to the ends of the earth.

UNITY THAT EMBRACES OUTSIDERS

The context of our Cross Connections
verse, Romans 15:7, is hugely important as we look to understand all the claims
that this command lays on us. Let's look at the surrounding verses:

__

_May the God of endurance and
encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord
with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the God and
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has
welcomed you, for the glory of God. For I tell you that Christ became a servant
to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises
given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for
his mercy._

In Romans 15, Paul is
reaching the end of his glorious unpacking of the gospel and its implications for
believers. What you might not realize, however, is that Paul had a specific
purpose in mind for writing Romans. He had never visited the church in Rome,
but he planned to, and wanted the church's support for his intended mission to
Spain. He wanted the Roman church to serve as a launching pad for his mission
to preach Christ where he had never been named, to bring the gospel to
unreached peoples past Italy, in Spain and Gaul and beyond. So he wrote Romans
to lay out his gospel, so that the church would join him in helping him spread
it to the unreached. Romans, in other words, is a missionary support letter.

And so, as he comes to the
close of his letter and begins turning his attention to a final missionary
appeal, he shares his heart for the Roman church, and for us: that we, grounded
in this great gospel, would be so passionate about unity and outreach, that the
natural bent of our hearts and lives would be directed towards God's mission to
our neighborhoods and the nations.

Paul's prayer of blessing
for the Romans, and for us, is found in Romans 15:5- "May the God of
endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another,
in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the
God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."

****

**MELODY VS. HARMONY**

This prayer for unity
paints a beautiful picture of what true Christian unity looks like: not
monolithic sameness or conformity, but rather common love and common purpose in
the midst of diversity. The key to seeing this vision lies in the word
"harmony." "May God...grant you to live in such harmony with one
another..." The picture here is of the church being one choir, with one
song, made up of many different voices singing different parts.

Harmony, as you probably
know, is a musical term. It refers to the orderly arrangement and blending of
different notes and parts to create a fuller, more beautiful sound. A good
choir doesn't have everybody singing the same notes at the same time. Some
people sing the melody, some people harmonize high notes based off the melody,
some harmonize bass notes based off the melody, and together all the different
notes blend together into one beautiful song.

That picture is exactly
the vision Paul lays out for the church in Romans 15:5-6\. Christian unity
doesn't mean looking the same or acting the same, or even, surprisingly, all
believing the same things about everything. Christian unity doesn't mean that
everyone in your church dresses the same, or likes the same music, or come from
the same racial or socio-economic or political or denominational backgrounds.
In fact, Paul is praying for the opposite: that our churches would be filled
with suit-wearers and flip-flop wearers, with people who like hymns and people
who like rock n' roll, with black and white and every other race, with rich and
poor, with Democrat and Republican. The unity that Paul is after here in Romans
15, and the unity that Jesus prayed for in John 17, is a unity of common love
and common purpose in the midst of diversity.

Firstly, Biblical unity
comes together around a common love-- God's saving love for us and our love for
him. That's what the little phrase, "in accord with Christ Jesus"
means. This harmony lines up with Jesus' heart of love, who came into the world
on a mission of sacrificial, substitutionary love. He came on a mission of
welcome: to welcome us, to throw open the doors of heaven to sinners, and to
make sure the way of salvation. That saving message is the center of biblical
unity.

This means that unity and
harmony can, and should, exist across denominational, racial, economic,
personality, and political lines. These differences are real, and important,
and we may disagree on important points, but what unites believers transcends
all other human categories. If you have eyes to see it, you have more in common
with a believer who has a very different personality than you, or who is from a
different denomination, race, and political group, than you do with an
unbelieving family member: you share a Savior and a Spirit and a Father and a
hope of unending joy and glory together. One day, all political parties will
cease, all denominational walls will fall, and redeemed people with redeemed
personalities from every tribe and language and nation will be united in worship
around the throne, praising the Lamb who was slain. Biblical unity strives to
make that future scene more and more a reality in the present.

Secondly, biblical unity
comes together around a common purpose: "that together you may with one
voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." God's glory--
his great worth, power, beauty, and value-- is most clearly seen when diverse
people come together in support of one great vision and one great cause: the
fame and renown of Jesus in all our lives and in all the world. If one group of
similar people had a singular purpose like that, the watching world could
easily brush it off as yet another group with another agenda. But the reality
of Jesus' work in our hearts shines compellingly when vastly different people
unite around this common purpose. When the world sees black and white and
Republican and Democrat and rich and poor united in singing, "Worthy is
the Lamb who was slain!" they have no explanation for that. And Jesus is
greatly glorified.

I stress this point of
unity in the midst of diversity because it is foundational to the conclusion
that Paul draws in verse 7\. What's the necessary outcome of a unity built on
the harmony of diversity and a common love and common purpose? "Therefore,
welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God." Our
common love and common purpose will necessarily be bent outwards to include
those on the outside.

True biblical unity
embraces outsiders, because our common love says that Jesus came to seek and
save the lost, and our common purpose says that his glory shines brightest when
different people unite in praising him. If those things are true, how could we
continue to stay in our homogenous holy huddles and ignore those on the
outside? That's not gospel-centered biblical unity; that's false unity built on
human dividing lines.

Have you thought of your
own tendency to only hang out with your friends and to neglect intentional
welcoming in such stark terms? It's not wrong to have friends who are similar
to you, and to enjoy their company. But when you gravitate to those who are
like you, whose company you enjoy, who share your interests, to the exclusion
of others and to the neglect of intentionally reaching out to others, you have
established false unity built on human, worldly dividing lines, and are living
contrary to the gospel.

Instead, a life centered
on the common love of the gospel and common purpose of glorifying God looks
relentlessly outward and intentionally tries to connect with others to welcome
them and bring them into community. Welcoming others and building
gospel-centered unity in diversity is your mission. This means that when you're
in church on Sunday, you're on mission; when you're hanging out with friends,
you're on mission; when you're at the office, you're on mission. Life is
mission work, an endless seeking and welcoming (more on that later).

AS CHRIST HAS WELCOMED YOU

After establishing this
vision for harmony in diversity, Paul proceeds to connect our own welcoming
spirit to three things: Jesus' cross, Jesus' glory, and Jesus' mission.

We can clearly see the
Cross Connection in the phrase, "as Christ has welcomed you."
"Welcome one another," Paul says, "in the same way as Christ has
welcomed you." But what exactly does that mean?

****

**MAKING ENEMIES FRIENDS**

One way Christ has
welcomed us is by turning enemies of God into friends of God. "While we
were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son" (Romans
5:10). Jesus went to the cross so that people like you and me, who by nature
are opposed to God's rule in our lives, could have our sins forgiven and our
hearts changed, and be brought into never-ending relationship with our Creator.
You were once an enemy of God; now, if you have trusted Christ, you are friends
with the Creator of the universe. How that should take our breath away!

This means that if we're
going to welcome people in the same way that Christ welcomed us, our
"welcoming" means extending our intentionality beyond our friends,
beyond our acquaintances, even beyond people we don't know, and it means
looking for opportunities to reconcile with those who have wronged us. Does
that sound hard to you? Of course it is; but the best way to cultivate a heart
that is inclined toward enemies is by continually returning to this truth again
and again: God's heart is inclined towards enemies like you, and you owe
everything to that.

****

**SEEKING AND SAVING THE LOST**

Jesus didn't go after the
"good people" (as if there were any), or the people who were like him
(again, as if there were any). No, he said that he had come into the world
"to seek and save the lost" (Luke 19:10). He purposefully and
intentionally went after the broken, the sinful, the worst. He hung out with
tax collectors and prostitutes (would you be willing to be seen in such
company?); he invited himself over to the house of Zaccheus, who was the most
despised man in town. He was so intentional about this that it damaged his
reputation; he was known as "the friend of sinners" (a name that, while
precious to us, was intended to be an insult).

What do your relationships
say about you? Certainly, we have to be careful and wise in how we pursue
relationships with worldly people; we are much more liable to temptation in
these areas than Jesus was. On the other hand, though, the solution is not to
protect ourselves from the world and stay in our homogenous holy huddles. We
should be intentional about building relationships with unbelievers, and look
for ways that our love for Jesus can rub off on them.

****

**BREAKING DOWN DIVIDING WALLS**

Ephesians 2 says that
another way Jesus has welcomed us was by dying in our place to break down the
dividing walls of hostility that keep us from fellowship with God and
fellowship with each other. "He himself is our peace, who has made us both
one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility by
abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances" (Colossians
2:14-15). One benefit of the death of Christ is that it brought an end to the
Old Testament law's purpose of separating God's people from the nations;
everything that excluded outsiders and kept God's people insular and separated
was fulfilled by Jesus and abolished in his death, which inaugurated a new
covenant for all who trust in him. The new covenant, bought by Jesus' blood,
transformed holiness from an external dividing wall to an internal agent of
transformation (see Ezekiel 36:25-27). Because of this new covenant, God's
people are no longer a people defined by exclusion, but by mission: "You
will be my witnesses... to the ends of the earth" (Acts 1:8), Jesus said.

One of the implications of
Ephesians 2 is that the gospel breaks down our dividing walls as well. What
separates you from others, and keeps you from embracing them with a spirit of
gospel-centered, missions-driven welcome? Who are "those people" that
you don't associate with, or steer clear of-- people with a certain appearance,
a certain race, those from a certain school... or maybe just people you don't
know? Jesus died to break down all the walls that separate you from God, and
you from others, and now his call for you is to live that out as you
"welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you."

We could go on and on with
all the ways that Jesus has welcomed us: adopting rebels into his family,
opening the doors of heaven to sinners, granting access to the throne of grace
and more. Or we could look at all the ways Jesus displayed a welcoming spirit
in his earthly ministry; he had compassion on those who interrupted his plans,
he welcomed little children, and he never turned away those who needed him. His
whole life was a life of welcome, and with his Spirit living through us, our
lives should look the same.

FOR THE GLORY OF GOD

The second thing that Paul
connects our welcoming to is the biggest possible reality in the universe: the
glory of God. And he shows us how both Jesus' welcome to us in the gospel, and
our own gospel-driven welcome to others, have God's glory as their ultimate
goal. 

Our own welcoming spirit,
perhaps more than any other single trait, will commend Christ to outsiders.
This is what Jesus prayed for us: "that they may all be one... so that the
world may believe that you have sent me." The reality of Jesus Christ's
saving mission will be demonstrated in our unity-- not our homogenous holy
huddles, but our embracing, diverse, Christ-centered unity that reaches out and
welcomes others. That's why Paul said, "Welcome one another, as Christ has
welcomed you, for the glory of God." 

On Sunday morning, as you
are thinking about who to talk to-- that newcomer in the pew in front of you,
or your friends sitting behind you-- God's glory is at stake. Will Jesus be on
display as you reach out to those on the outside, or will he be obscured behind
the wall of separation that you put up as you turn to those who are already in
your group?

This aim of glorifying God
is the aim that Jesus had in welcoming us. You can see that again in the
command from Romans 15:7:"Welcome one another, as Christ has welcomed you,
for the glory of God." That doesn't just mean that we welcome one another
for God's glory. It also means that Christ has welcomed us for God's glory.
What Paul is saying is, "Welcome one another in the same way and for the
same reason that Christ has welcomed you; in other words, for the glory of
God." God's glory is the central reason why you, an unworthy sinner,
alienated from God, have been welcomed into his kingdom and his family. His
fame, and the display of his worth, love, and power, is why you are a believer
today.

This has profound
implications for the command to welcome one another, because of the ultimate
reason behind that command. The reason why God commands us to welcome one
another is not so that we'll all be happy and sing "Kumbaya"
together, but ultimately so that his fame will reach from our lives to our
neighborhood to the nations, until "the earth will be filled with the
knowledge of the glory of LORD as waters cover the sea" (Habakkuk 2:14).
And as Paul brings his missionary support letter to a close in Romans 15, thats
where he turns our attention.

SO THAT THE NATIONS MIGHT GLORIFY GOD

After saying that we
should welcome one another for God's glory, because Jesus welcomed us for God's
glory, Paul draws out a conclusion that has massive implications for missions
and the way we live our lives. 

__

_Welcome one another as Christ has
welcomed you, for the glory of God. _

"Welcome one another
for the glory of God," Paul says, "because that's exactly what Jesus
came to do." Verse 8 begins with "For" or "Because,"
meaning that Paul is giving this as the foundational reason for obeying the
command in verse 7 to welcome one another. Trace Paul's logic from verse 7-9:
we should welcome one another for the same reason Christ welcomed us-- in other
words, for the glory of God-- because Jesus came for two primary reasons: to
prove that God keeps his promises to his people (verse 8), and so that the
nations would join his people in praising God forever (verses 9-12).

In verse 9, we're given
the first reason that the Son of God became incarnate as a man: he became a
servant to the circumcised (in other words, to God's covenant people, the Jews)
to show God's truthfulness and to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs.
Jesus came in the fullness of time to prove that God keeps all his promises--
"all the promises of God find their 'yes' in him" (2 Corinthians
1:20). From the first promise of a Savior given to Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:15),
to the promise of universal blessing given to Abraham (Genesis 12:2-3), to the
promise that a descendant of David would rule forever (2 Samuel 7:16), to all
of God's promises to never leave or forsake his people, Jesus came to purchase,
prove, and confirm all of them. God's trustworthiness has been completely
vindicated in the saving life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.

But Paul doesn't stop
there. Jesus didn't just come to make a happy, holy huddle out of people who
believe his promises; he came to earth so that his grace to spill out of the
banks of Israel and flood the world with praise. "Christ became a
servant... in order that the nations might glorify God for his mercy."

Hear the connection that
Paul makes between our welcoming one another, and Jesus' mission to the nations
in Romans 15:7-9: "Welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the
glory of God, because Christ became a servant in order that the nations might
glorify God for his mercy." In other words, the ultimate aim of us
welcoming others is the same aim Jesus has: that our open-hearted, open-armed
servanthood would bend our attention and affection away from ourselves and
toward outsiders and the ends of the earth. The call to welcome one another is
the call to put our lives and relationships on mission and use every opportunity
as a platform to extend the worship of Jesus to more and more people.

One of the best ways to
begin to cultivate a heart for missions and the nations is by beginning to obey
the command of Romans 15:7 to welcome one another. Intentionally bending your
life towards welcoming outsiders and building bridges to those who are
different from you is the first practical step towards being a Great Commission
Christian. If you're happy in your homogenous holy huddle and not involved in
actively expanding your circle to include outsiders, then you're certainly not
involved in the radical, sacrificial sending and going that the Great
Commission requires.

Paul's connection between
welcoming and missions shows us the seriousness, weight, and global
implications for this command. The command, "welcome one another"
extends far beyond coffee fellowship time on Sunday morning and includes God's
mission to make his Son famous to the ends of the earth. "Welcome one
another" is way more significant than whether or not people are happy
visiting our homes and churches; the glory of God, the salvation of the lost,
the completion of the Great Commission, and the everlasting worship of a
redeemed people are at stake. That's not hyperbole; that's Romans 15:7-12\.

The ultimate goal of the
command "welcome one another" is not fellowship, it's missions; and
the ultimate goal of missions is worship. We practice the art and discipline of
welcome and open-armed fellowship both to train our hearts towards reaching the
lost, and to invite the lost and outsider into our experience of praising the
Lamb who was slain. "Praise the Lord, all you nations, and let all the
peoples extol him" (Romans 15:11) is the heart cry that will sustain the
hard work, open eyes, intentionality, and perseverance that the command
"welcome one another" requires. 

So let's work diligently
to make connections in our lives between these great realities: unity in
diversity, the gospel welcoming us, the glory of God, and Jesus' praise among
the nations. God is calling for our open doors and open hearts to commend
Christ to our neighbors and to the nations, and for us to put our lives and our
relationships on mission. Where has God put you in positions where you can be a
smiling face, a warm handshake, a new friend, an open ear, an open door, and
open heart, and a clear gospel witness?

__

_Thank you, Lord Jesus, for going to such
extraordinary lengths to welcome an alienated sinner like me. Thank you for
laying down your rights and laying down your rights by dying in my place, and
then by your Spirit pursuing me with holy abandon until you made me yours. Give
me a heart like yours, that beats to extend your grace to others and longs to
see your praise extend to the ends of the earth. Help me to love your glory
more than I love my comfort zone, and push me outside of myself to be your
hands and feet to those on the outside._
