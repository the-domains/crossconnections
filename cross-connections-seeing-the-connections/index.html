reason why we tend to not see these cross connections; it's the reason why it
took me eight years of my Christian life to start seeing them.</p><p>It has to do with how we read the Bible.</p><p>Most of us have the tendency
to "pluck" Bible verses out of context and to think about them
divorced from how they relate to the text from which they come. It's
understandable; after all, our Bibles come to us pre-divided into convenient
chapters and verses.</p><p>This makes it easy
to find our way around in a relatively thick book.</p><p>But it's practically begging for us to pull
out verses and say, "Here's what Ephesians 4:31 says," without
bothering to think about what Ephesians 4:30 or 4:32 say, or how they might
relate to Ephesians 4:31.</p><p>John Piper, one of the
preachers and teachers that God used to deeply shape my Christian walk, once
compared this style of Bible reading to a pearl necklace. We tend to look at
verses in the Bible like a string of pearls; this one is pretty, this one is
shiny, this one is helpful, and so on.</p><p>We memorize verses like John 3:16- "For God so loved the world that
he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him might not perish but have
eternal life," but we don't stop to consider the context.</p><p>You see, John 3:16 wasn't written to be a
single pearl.</p><p>It connects to John 3:15
and John 3:17.</p><p>In fact, when John wrote
it, there weren't any verse numbers- those were added hundreds of years later
to help us navigate the Bible.</p><p>Do you see the little word
at the beginning of John 3:16?</p><p>"For."</p><p>I'm willing to
bet that every time you've ever heard John 3:16, you've never thought about the
first word in the sentence.</p><p>What does
"for" mean?</p><p>It's a logical
word, a connecting word.</p><p>It means
"because."</p><p>It connects one
sentence or clause logically with the sentence or clause that precedes it.</p><p>For example, I might say, "I ate an
entire pizza today, for I was very hungry."</p><p>"I was very hungry" is the reason
that I ate an entire pizza.</p><p>Memorizing John 3:16 without
giving a thought to that first word "for" is like focusing on the
second half of my example sentence, "for I was very hungry."</p><p>"For I was very hungry"- by itself
it hardly makes sense.</p><p>You need the
first half of the logical argument to get the whole picture.</p><p>In the same way, you need to see what comes
before and after John 3:16 for it to fully make sense.</p><p>Here's the whole thing in context:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>The Son of Man must be lifted up, so
that whoever believes in him may have eternal life, for God so loved the world,
that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but
have eternal life for God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the
world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.</i></p><p>The word "for"
is often overlooked by us, because we tend to not use it in everyday
conversation.</p><p>We tend to use the word
"because" instead.</p><p>That's
fine; they mean the same thing. I probably wouldn't say, "I ate an entire
pizza today for I was very hungry." I would probably say, "I ate an
entire pizza today because I was very hungry."</p><p>So here's my first
suggestion: every time you see that logical connecting word "for" in
the Bible, substitute the word "because."</p><p>That will make you see it more clearly.</p><p>Do that in John 3:15-17, and the meaning
suddenly becomes clear:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>The Son of Man must be lifted up, so
that whoever believes in him may have eternal life, </i></p><p><i><b>because</b></i></p><p> God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that
whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life </p><p><i><b>because</b></i></p><p> God did not send his Son into
the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved
through him.</p><p>Do you see how the
argument builds? Everyone who believes in Jesus gets eternal life, because God
loved the world in this way: that he gave his only Son, so that we could escape
perishing, because God sent his Son not to condemn but to save.</p><p>These logical connections
are especially prevalent in Paul's epistles, because he tends to build long
arguments with premises and conclusions. You don't see the arguments unless you
see the connecting words.</p><p>But it's
crucial to see those connecting words, because the real power of Paul's
letters, and the real power of the gospel, lies in the arguments that he
makes.</p><p>One more example:</p><p>In Romans 1, Paul tells
the church that he is eager to visit Rome so that he can preach the gospel to
them.</p><p>Preaching the gospel is a good
thing.</p><p>We should want to preach the
gospel too.</p><p>And Paul is really helpful
here, because he doesn't just tell the church he wants to preach the gospel; he
tells them why.</p><p>The problem is, we've
broken up his argument into nice, tidy, little verses and paragraphs, so we
hardly ever see it.</p><p>Look at Romans
1:15-17:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>I am eager to preach the gospel to
you also who are in Rome. For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the
power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also
to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for
faith.</i></p><p>Now take out each
"for" and put in "because."</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>I am eager to preach the gospel to
you also who are in Rome, </i></p><p><i></i><i><b>because</b></i></p><p> I
am not ashamed of the gospel, </p><p><i><b>because</b></i></p><p>
it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew
first and also to the Greek, </p><p><i><b>because</b></i></p><p>
in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith.</p><p>Those "becauses"
are the key to evangelism. Paul is eager to preach the gospel, because he's not
ashamed of it.</p><p>And he's not ashamed of
the gospel, because he knows that the gospel is God's power to save everyone
who believes.</p><p>And the gospel is God's
power to save, because in it God's perfect righteousness is credited to those
who believe (that's what he means by "revealed from faith for
faith"). The foundation of Paul's desire for evangelism is the doctrine of
justification by faith. The gospel is at the bottom of his explanation for why
he loves evangelism. Simply put, if you struggle with evangelism, it's because
you've missed Paul's argument; you haven't connected the power of justification
to the command to evangelize.</p><p>One of my Bible professors
opened my eyes to biblical arguments in a simple, life-changing way.</p><p>He said, "Every time you see a
'therefore', ask, 'What's it there for?'" Each of those logical connecting
words serves a purpose- and its purpose is to transform you.</p><p>The simple observation
that the Bible argues changed my life.</p><p>No longer was the Bible a string of pearls, with each verse disconnected
from the others and made to be examined and appreciated independently.</p><p>No, the Bible was a chain- a chain of
linking, building arguments, one thought leading to the next thought leading to
the next thought. If the translation you use to read the Bible doesn't have
these logical connecting words (the NIV is particularly notorious for dropping
"for," "so that," and "because"), throw it out
and get a more accurate translation that preserves the flow of thought (like
the ESV or NASB). That might sound extreme, but it is absolutely critical that
you see these in the Bible. Those logical connections in the Bible will unlock
a world of gospel power as you start to see biblical authors talking about the
cross and then drawing logical inferences and conclusions to your life.</p><p>Most of the cross connections that follow are
simply observations of this phenomenon.</p><p>Once you start to read your Bible like this, you'll see them too.</p><p>Pearls are pretty. But chains are
strong.</p><p>Don't build your life on the
prettiness of pearls; build on the strength of chains.</p><p>God's design for these
Cross Connections is that the power of the gospel would connect to specific
areas of our lives and transform them.</p><p>But just as there are myriad ways that God calls us to obey him, and
just as the gospel is like a glorious, multi-faceted diamond in all of its
perfections, so Cross Connections do not all function the same way.</p><p>God knows that different circumstances call
for different motivations, and he is kind to condescend to our weakness by
giving us exactly what we need in the gospel to empower our obedience to him.</p><p>Cross Connections motivate
obedience in three ways: by logical argument, by the power of example, and the
offer of promise.</p><p>These three categories
are not mutually exclusive, but seeing them clearly and understanding them will
help us press further into the power of the gospel to transform our lives.</p><p>A word of explanation is
in order here.</p><p>You might be wondering
why this introduction is going on and on- you might be thinking, "Get to
the Cross Connections, already!" But since I believe that the power of
these Cross Connections lies in specific Scriptures connected to specific acts
of obedience, I want to be as specific as possible in our study of them.</p><p>Too many Christians settle for a shallow
reading of God's Word, and shallow lives are the inevitable result.</p><p>If you want to go deep with God- a deeper
fellowship with him, deeper intimacy, deeper love, deeper joy, deeper
obedience- then a deeper, closer study of his Word is a necessity. God has
chosen to reveal himself in a book; we would do well, then, to study it.
"Great are the works of the LORD, studied by all who delight in them"
(Psalm 111:2).</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>LOGICAL ARGUMENT</b></p><p>You've seen how this type
of Cross Connection works already in Romans 1:15-17, which we looked at
previously, but I want to unpack it a little further. The power of biblical
arguments- a series of logical steps leading to a conclusion- lies in their
ability to change the way we think. "Be transformed by the renewing of
your mind," Paul admonished in Romans 12. The main practical way that our
mind is renewed is by pressing the Bible's logic into the way we reason and
weigh options and make decisions, until the way the Bible thinks becomes the
way we think.</p><p>Let's revisit Romans
1:15-17 to unpack this a little further. Remember how we changed each
"for" to "because" in order to see the logical steps more
clearly?</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>I am eager to preach the gospel to
you also who are in Rome, </i></p><p><i></i><i><b>because</b></i></p><p> I
am not ashamed of the gospel, </p><p><i><b>because</b></i></p><p>
it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew
first and also to the Greek, </p><p><i><b>because</b></i></p><p>
in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith.</p><p>Paul's reasoning starts at
his conclusion and moves down to the foundation of his argument.</p><p>"I am eager to preach the gospel"
is his conclusion, the point he is trying to make and defend.</p><p>The rest of the argument explains why he's
eager to preach the gospel, and each "because" moves down to a more
fundamental reason.</p><p>Here's what I mean, by way
of example. Recall my logical argument, "I ate an entire pizza today,
because I was hungry." That's a simple two-step argument-- conclusion and
one reason. "I ate an entire pizza today" is the result of me being
hungry.</p><p>But let's suppose that you
really wanted to press into why I would eat an entire pizza in one sitting.
(This, of course, is a silly example; no one cares why I would eat a whole
pizza. But Paul's argument is of vital importance; it is crucial that we not
only know that he was eager to preach the gospel, but that we know why, so that
his inspired reasons can become our reasons).</p><p>Let's flesh out my example
argument a little. "I ate an entire pizza today, </p><p><i></i><b>because</b></p><p> I was hungry, </p><p><b>because</b></p><p>
I went to the gym this morning." Now we know a little more; I ate a whole
pizza, ultimately, because I went to the gym this morning.</p><p>Going to the gym was the foundational reason
for my gorging on pizza.</p><p>You can unpack
it like this:</p><p>1. I ate an entire pizza today, </p><p><b>because</b></p><p>2. I was hungry, </p><p><b>because</b></p><p>3. I went to the gym this morning.</p><p>If you want to see it even
more clearly, you can work the argument in reverse, and change each
"because" to a "therefore" (you can think of
"because" as a logical word that works from conclusion to foundation,
and "therefore" as a logical word that works the other way, from foundation
to conclusion). Observe:</p><p>1. I went to the gym this morning, </p><p><b>therefore</b></p><p>2. I was hungry, </p><p><b>therefore</b></p><p>3. I ate an entire pizza today.</p><p>Now let's apply this silly
example to the inspired, life-changing logic of Romans 1:15-17.</p><p>1. I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who
are in Rome, </p><p><b>because</b></p><p>2. I am not ashamed of the gospel, </p><p><b>because</b></p><p>3. It is the power of God unto salvation to
everyone who believes, </p><p><b>because</b></p><p>4. In it the righteousness of God is revealed from
faith for faith.</p><p>Now work the argument in
reverse by substituting "therefore," and you'll more clearly see how
the gospel is supposed to function in empowering our evangelism:</p><p>1. In it the righteousness of God is revealed from
faith for faith, </p><p><b>therefore</b></p><p>2. It is the power of God unto salvation to
everyone who believes, </p><p><b>therefore</b></p><p>3. I am not ashamed of the gospel, </p><p><b>therefore</b></p><p>4. I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who
are in Rome.</p><p>Paul connects the
objective, glorious truth of justification-- that in Christ, God's
righteousness is credited to believers through faith-- to a specific,
subjective result: being eager to preach the gospel. It's all well and good to
say that, but the logical steps make that connection come to life and give it
power. God's righteousness is credited to believers in the gospel; therefore
the gospel is God's power to hold those believers all the way to final
salvation (that's how Paul always uses the phrase "unto salvation").
Because Paul knows that it is the gospel of God's free gift of righteousness
that will preserve him as a believer, he is not ashamed of that gospel (how
could you be, when free access to God's presence and never-ending joy and life
is promised to you?). And because Paul is confident and unashamed in God's
grace, that unashamedness manifests itself in eagerness-- eagerness to preach
the gospel. </p><p>Knowing those logical
steps-- not just in your head but in your heart-- is the key to eager
evangelism.</p><p>This is how eager evangelism
comes about, not by efforts or programs or classes or books, but by the Holy
Spirit taking the truth of justification and its logical inferences and setting
fire to it in your heart, so that God's revealed righteousness burns in your
life with flames of eager gospel preaching.</p><p>So every time you read
your Bible, take my professor's advice. When you see a 'therefore,' ask
"What's it there for?" Follow the argument from foundation to
conclusion, and pray that the Holy Spirit will ignite those logical chains into
life-changing transformation.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE POWER OF EXAMPLE</b></p><p>The second way that Cross
Connections function is by holding up Jesus in the gospel as an example worthy
of our emulation.</p><p>Many, perhaps most, of
the Cross Connections in the New Testament work on this principle.</p><p>One of the most obvious
examples of this type of Cross Connection is in 1 Peter 2.</p><p>Peter wrote this epistle to a group of
Christians who were struggling under persecution, encouraging them not to give
up. </p><p>The issue at hand is
enduring faithfully under persecution and suffering. Perhaps you take a stand
for truth at work and get passed over for a promotion. Perhaps the other
students at school know you're a Christian and subtly (or not so subtly) put
you down and deride you. Or perhaps, as is happening even while I write this,
you're one of the Christians in Iraq forced to flee from the threat of
imprisonment and beheading. In the face of such persecution, whether it is mild
or life-threatening, how are you supposed to endure? In 1 Peter 2:20-21, Peter
connects this experience to the cross:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>"If when you do good and suffer
for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. For to this
you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example,
so that you might follow in his steps." ~1 Peter 2:20-21</i></p><p>One way that God intends
for you to endure is by seeing the example of Christ and imitating him.</p><p>The gospel is a powerful story- a story of a
King who, in response to our rebellion, steps off his throne, trades places
with the rebels, pays their penalty, and then gives them his entire
kingdom.</p><p>There is much in this story
worthy of emulation.</p><p>One important word of
caution is in order, however.</p><p>Some
people, in seeing these "example-type" Cross Connections everywhere
in the Bible, make a tragic and fatal error.</p><p>Rather than seeing the gospel as the power that makes our imitation of
Jesus possible, they make his example into the gospel itself.</p><p>They say, "Jesus came as a good teacher
to show what life with God is like; he healed and taught and did good and stood
for righteousness and finally submitted nonviolently to oppression.</p><p>We should be like that."</p><p>Well, yes, that's true.</p><p>But too many people make his example into the
gospel itself- the gospel is boiled down to "Jesus gave us an example so
that we would act like him." </p><p>Let me say emphatically
that, while that sentence is true, it is not the gospel.</p><p>If all that Jesus' life and death
accomplished was to give us an example to follow, there is no good news and no
gospel.</p><p>Having an impossibly perfect
example to follow is not good news; it is bad news. Seeing Jesus' love for
others and being expected to imitate him is bad news because I can't do it.
Unless Jesus' love for others in the Bible is an expression of His saving,
redeeming, transforming love for me, His example only adds to my guilt-- it's
just one more thing God requires of me that I don't do well enough.</p><p>So when you come to an
"example-type" Cross Connection in the Bible, don't make the fatal
mistake of confusing the gospel with the example.</p><p>The gospel is the good news that in Jesus'
life, death and resurrection, eternal life and forgiveness of sins is offered
to all who will repent and trust in him. There are numerous examples in that
gospel for us to follow, but they are not the gospel in themselves.</p><p>But there's another
mistake that's easier to make when looking at these types of Cross Connections,
one that is more subtle but perhaps just as destructive. It would be easy to
look at an "example-type" Cross Connection and be discouraged by the
seemingly impossible duty it lays on you.</p><p>You might read 1 Peter 2:21 and think, "It's great that Jesus did
that, but how am I supposed to be like that? I get bummed out when I stub my
toe; how am I supposed to endure real suffering like he did?"</p><p>The reason that we can so
often get discouraged by the example of Jesus is because we're mistaken on how
those examples are supposed to function in our lives.</p><p>Simply put, we've been approaching the
example of Jesus as duty; i.e., this is what we're supposed to be like.</p><p>But what if, instead, we're supposed to see
in the example of Jesus, not just duty, but delight?</p><p>I believe that seeing
these "example-type" Cross Connections as primarily delight instead
of duty is the key to their power.</p><p>They're not in the Bible to shake their finger at us and say, "Now
you'd better be like this!"</p><p>Rather,
they stand in Scripture as a shining light saying, "Look at what your
Savior is like!</p><p>See his beauty! Know his
kindness! Feel his love! Stand in awe of his glory! Be amazed by his grace!
Look and live!"</p><p>I know that this is how
these Cross Connections are intended to function, because 2 Corinthians 3:18
tells us that this is exactly how transformation happens in the Christian life:
"And we all, with unveiled face, </p><p><i>beholding
the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image</i></p><p>, from one
degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord, who is the
Spirit."</p><p>As we behold Jesus' glory
in the gospel-- the glory of his love, the glory of his humility, the glory of
his patient suffering-- the Holy Spirit opens our eyes to see his glory for
what it really is-- compelling, beautiful, valuable, worthy of imitation.</p><p>It is that spiritual sight of glory in the
gospel that changes us to be more like him.</p><p>Take our example from 1
Peter 2:21 for instance.</p><p>If you only read
2:21 ("To this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you,
leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps"), you might
only see duty.</p><p>But keep reading, and it
becomes clear that the Holy Spirit's goal is for you to see glory, and delight
in that glory, and ultimately be transformed by that glory.</p><p>Seriously, keep reading:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>To this you have been called, because
Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow
in his steps. He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When
he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not
threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. He himself
bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to
righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like
sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</i></p><p>The note of emphasis in
this passage falls, not on duty, but on delight.</p><p>See who your Savior is, and what he has done
for you! He is the utterly sinless One, perfect in holiness, ever-truthful and
righteous. And yet see his response to the treacherous, blasphemous revilings
of his enemies (treacherous, blasphemous enemies like you!): he did not return
evil for evil or mocking for mocking.</p><p>Instead, he prayed "Father, forgive them"-- he prayed this for
you.</p><p>He entrusted himself to the Father
whose perfect justice will ultimately hold sway in every heart and every corner
of the universe, the same Father who loves you, adopted you, and watches over
your way.</p><p>And in doing this, he
displayed far more than an example to be followed; he accomplished your
salvation.</p><p>Every sin you have ever
committed, each of which merit an eternity of punishment, were laid on his
shoulders and paid in full by the priceless blood of Jesus.</p><p>He stood in your place that you might stand
in his place-- dead to sin and alive to righteousness, full of joy and peace
forever.</p><p>His wounds, more terrible and
painful than you could ever know, have bought full and complete healing for
you, which has begun now in part and will be fully yours in the new heavens and
new earth.</p><p>You were the lost sheep that
he left to find-- you and every other person who will turn from their sin and
embrace the Savior, the Good Shepherd, who laid down his life for you.</p><p>God intends for this
portrait of the Good Shepherd to sustain the suffering of his sheep. The way
these "example-type" Cross Connections work to motivate is to hold
before you a picture of Jesus, exactly the picture that you need to empower the
obedience he is calling you to in that moment.</p><p>If you are suffering unjustly, as in the above example, you need the
glory of the suffering Savior to sustain and transform you so that you can bear
up under it. So when you come to these kinds of Cross Connections, don't
meditate on the command in view; meditate on the cross in view, until the glory
of Jesus presented there fills your mind and heart, giving you the strength you
need to move forward in obedience.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE OFFER OF PROMISE</b></p><p>The final way that Cross
Connections motivate is by the offer of promises.</p><p>In the gospel, God is holding out
indescribably wonderful promises to the believer- promises of forgiveness,
eternal life, fellowship with himself, all-sufficient strengthening grace, the
work of the Spirit in your life, answers to prayer, peace in trouble, security
in his care, reward in heaven, and the list goes on.</p><p>God intends for these promises to sustain our
obedience, especially when life gets hard.</p><p>Jerry Bridges says it this
way: "The best kept secret among Christians is this: Jesus paid it all. I
mean all. He not only purchased your forgiveness of sins and your ticket to
Heaven, He purchased every blessing and every answer to prayer you will ever
receive. Every one of them- no exceptions."</p><p>Every promise holds out
hope for something in the future.</p><p>In the
gospel, these promises of future grace are secured and guaranteed by God's acts
of past grace-- the cross, where every blessing you will ever receive was
purchased for you. In response to promises, faith looks back to the cross and
says, "Yes, God bought this promise for me, and proved his love for me
there," and then faith looks forward to the time when God will them as he
has said. </p><p>Looking forward, faith says,
"Yes, God will surely do this for me," and then proceeds to live as
if God really will do what he says.</p><p>Let me give you an
example. In Romans 8, Paul has reached the pinnacle of his unpacking of the
gospel.</p><p>Some of the biggest, deepest
promises in the Bible are here.</p><p>After 8
chapters of gospel, Paul responds in 8:31 with a rhetorical question brimming
with amazement: "What then shall we say to these things?" What
response could there possibly be to grace like this?</p><p>He continues:</p><p><i></i></p><p><i>If God is for us, who can be against
us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he
not also with him graciously give us all things?</i></p><p>This has been called the
biggest promise in the Bible- bigger, even, than Romans 8:28 which precedes
it.</p><p>It reaches back to the cross to
provide the strongest possible foundation-- God did not even spare his own Son
in his love for us; and looks forward to the widest possible promise-- this
same God will give all things, everything, to those who trust his Son.</p><p>Do you see how the promise
of future grace is grounded on the assurance of past grace? This Cross
Connection actually uses two different kinds of motivation at once; it's both a
logical argument (an argument from the greater to the lesser), and an offer of
promise. It argues that if God did the comparatively harder thing-- in this
case, giving up his own Son to death on a cross-- then we can be confident that
he will surely do the comparatively easier thing-- give everything else to those
who trust Jesus.</p><p>And the offer of
promise looks into the future-- a future where God has given the believer
everything-- and brings that back to the present for motivation: don't worry
about those who might be against you, because God is committed to giving you
everything in Christ.</p><p>These gospel promises are
everywhere in Scripture, and we'll see some of them in our study of Cross
Connections. As you read the Bible, look for promises, and pray for grace to
believe them.</p><p>This is one of the primary
ways to fight sin in your life.</p><p>For an
excellent resource on this topic, I suggest Battling Unbelief by John Piper.</p><p>With these introductory
lessons under out belts, we will now move on to examine eighteen Cross
Connections in more detail.</p><p>This book is
intentionally broad in its scope; part of my aim is to show that absolutely
everything in the Christian life is directly connected to the cross, and the
best way I can think of to show that is to deliberately walk through a wide
variety of biblical virtues. </p><p>Each chapter unpacks how
the gospel relates to one virtue that God calls Christians to walk in, and
includes application questions and an accompanying Bible study. The first nine
chapters center on the fruit of the Spirit- love, joy, peace, patience,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. It's fitting to
start with the fruit of the Spirit, since these are the central virtues of the
Christian life, and the proof of new life that Jesus said would be in every
disciple. These fruits, as we will find, grow best in the blood-soaked soil at
the foot of the cross.</p><p>The next nine
lessons are a sampling of other various cross connections, to give you a taste
of just how deep and pervasive this theme is in Scripture.</p><p>Each fruit and virtue of
the Christian life in this book is associated with an icon, a picture, that
relates to how the gospel connects to it. Love, for example, is depicted by a
mirror, since the Cross Connection verse we'll be looking at is Ephesians 5:1-
"Be imitators of God as dearly loved children and live a life of
love." Kindness is shown by a dollar sign since, as we'll unpack in that
chapter, kindness is costly. Joy is depicted by a drop of water, since our
Cross Connection verse is Isaiah 12:3- "With joy you will draw water from
the wells of salvation." Each of those icons is intended to be a pictorial
representation of each Cross Connection to help you more easily remember them. </p><p>My hope and prayer is that
through this study of Cross Connections, you will grow in your grasp on grace,
the cross will become more central and precious in your eyes, and that Jesus
will become more and more real as you see his grace in your life.</p><p>Soli Deo Gloria</p><picture>
